=== Agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajito

==== Renderings

- _agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajito_: gone forth from the household life into
the ascetic life

- _pabbajito_: gone forth [into the ascetic life]

==== Introduction

===== Agārasmā anagāriyaṃ: abandonment of the household life

_Agāra_ means house or hut, 'usually implying the comforts of living at home,'
says PED (sv _Agāra_). DOP calls _agāra_ 'the household life,' and _anagāra_
'the homeless state; the ascetic life.' We render _agārasmā anagāriyaṃ
pabbajito_ as 'gone forth from the household life into the ascetic life.' What
is abandoned in going forth is not a roof over one's head, but the property,
security, and pleasures of lay people, as expressed here:

[quote, M.1.179]
____
Abandoning an inconsiderable or considerable fortune, and an inconsiderable or
considerable circle of relatives, he shaves off his hair and beard, clothes
himself in ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into the ascetic
life.

_So aparena samayena appaṃ vā bhogakkhandhaṃ pahāya mahantaṃ vā
bhogakkhandhaṃ pahāya appaṃ vā ñātiparivaṭṭaṃ pahāya mahantaṃ
cā ñātiparivaṭṭaṃ pahāya kesamassuṃ ohāretvā kāsāyāni

[quote, Ud.57]

Soṇa Koṭikaṇṇa said 'It is not easy while living the household life to
live the religious life, utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell.'

_nayidaṃ sukaraṃ agāraṃ ajjhāvasatā ekantaparipuṇṇaṃ
ekantaparisuddhaṃ saṅkhalikhitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ carituṃ_

He said 'How about if I shaved off my hair and beard, and went forth from the
household life into the ascetic life?'

_Yannūnāhaṃ kesamassuṃ ohāretvā kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā
agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajeyyan ti_

Let me go forth [into the ascetic life], Master Mahākaccāna!"

_Pabbājetu maṃ bhante ayyo mahākaccāyano ti._

Mahākaccāna replied, "It is hard, Soṇa, the life-long, one-meal-a-day,
solitary bed, celibate life. Please, stay as a householder, apply yourself to
the Buddha's training system and, on the Observance Day, to observing
one-meal-a-day, the solitary bed, and celibacy.

=== Ajjhāyaka

==== Renderings

- _ajjhāyaka_: scholar [of the sacred texts]

==== Introduction

===== Ajjhāyaka means mantajjhāyaka

_Ajjhāyaka_ means 'one who studies,' but it is an abbreviation. The full term
is shown at M.1.282 to be _mantajjhāyaka_. Therefore _ajjhāyaka_ means
'scholar [of the sacred texts].' This is in accordance with PED which calls it
'a scholar of the brahmanic texts, a studious, learned person,' and the DOP,
'one who studies (the Vedas)' The Buddha in the following quote implies that it
can be applied to his own bhikkhus (because Brahmanists were priests not
ascetics), and the term is therefore not restricted to students of brahmanical
texts:

[quote, M.1.282]
____
I do not say that the asceticism of a scholar of the sacred texts is merely due
to his scholarship of sacred texts.

_Nāhaṃ bhikkhave mantajjhāyakassa mantajjhāyakamattena sāmaññaṃ

=== Aññadatthu uyyojanikapaṭisaṃyuttaṃyeva kathaṃ kattā hoti

==== Renderings

- _aññadatthu uyyojanikapaṭisaṃyuttaṃyeva kathaṃ kattā hoti_: he is
one whose words are exclusively connected with religious inspiration

==== Introduction

===== Other translations: Horner and Bodhi

This phrase is intended to illustrate how the ideal bhikkhu converses with
visitors. It occurs in the _Mahāsuññata Sutta_ (M.3.111) and the _Anuruddha
Sutta_ (A.4.233). Horner says it is 'a passage of great difficulty,' and says
this is because of the two meanings of _uyyojeti_

1. to incite, instigate, inspire, persuade

2. to dismiss.

For her translation she chooses the first meaning, saying the Buddha 'speaks
there as one intent only on inspiring them.' Bodhi, however, takes the second
meaning and says:

[quote, "Bodhi, MLDB p.972"]
____
'He invariably talks to them in a way concerned with dismissing them'

_aññadatthu uyyojanikapaṭisaṃyuttaṃyeva kathaṃ kattā hoti._
____

[quote, "Bodhi, NDB p.1164"]
____
'He gives them a talk invariably concerned with dismissing them'

_aññadatthu uyyojanikapaṭisaṃyuttaṃyeva kathaṃ kattā hoti._
____

===== Attitude uncharacteristic of Buddhism

Bodhi's translation suggests bhikkhus should adopt an attitude that is
uncharacteristic of Buddhism. For example, the scriptures are critical of the
bhikkhu who is incapable of benefiting others (_nālaṃ paresaṃ_) by
instructing, inspiring, rousing, and gladdening his companions in the religious
life (_no ca sandassako hoti samādapako samuttejako sampahaṃsako
sabrahmacārīnaṃ_ (A.4.298 ).

===== Uyyojeti: to dismiss

In the meaning 'to dismiss' _uyyojeti_ commonly occurs at the end of religious
discourses. For example:

[quote, D.2.86]
____
Then the Blessed One, having instructed, inspired, roused, and gladdened the
lay-followers of Pāṭaligāma with a religious discourse until far into the
night, he dismissed them (_uyyojesi_), saying: 'Householders, the night is
nearly over. Now it is time for you to do as you think fit.'

_Atha kho bhagavā pāṭaligāmiye upāsake bahudeva rattiṃ dhammiyā
kathāya sandassetvā samādapetvā samuttejetvā sampahaṃsetvā uyyojesi
abhikkantā kho gahapatayo ratti yassa'dāni tumhe kālaṃ maññathā ti._
____

In addressing the lay-followers of Pāṭaligāma, the Buddha was clearly doing
so for inspirational purposes, and the talk was eventually concluded with a
dismissal. It makes little sense, therefore, to say that the Buddha's sermons
were 'invariably concerned with dismissing' his audience, as if that had been
his abiding objective the whole night long.

===== The ideal bhikkhu's conversation

The _Mahāsuññata Sutta_, in which our passage occurs, goes on to helpfully
explain the nature of the ideal bhikkhu's conversation, as follows:

[quote, M.3.113]
____
If, Ānanda, this [ideal] bhikkhu... inclines to speaking, then he thinks: 'I
will not talk that kind of talk which is low, vulgar, the way of the common
man, ignoble, and unconducive to spiritual well-being, and which does not
conduce to disillusionment [with originated phenomena], nor to non-attachment
[to originated phenomena], nor to the ending [of originated phenomena], nor to
inward peace, nor to transcendent insight, nor to enlightenment, nor to the
Untroubled

_Tassa ce ānanda bhikkhuno iminā vihārena viharato kathāya cittaṃ namati.
So yāyaṃ kathā hīnā gammā pothujjanikā anariyā anatthasaṃhitā na
nibbidāya na virāgāya na nirodhāya na upasamāya na abhiññāya na
sambodhāya na nibbānāya saṃvattati (... evarūpiṃ kathaṃ na
kathessāmiti)._

(...) That is to say: talk of kings, thieves, great ministers, armies, dangers,
battles, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands, scents, relations, vehicles,
villages, market towns, towns, the country, women, valiant men, streets, wells,
departed spirits, tittle-tattle, legends about the world, legends about the
sea, talk of honour and renown.'

_Seyyathīdaṃ rājakathā corakathā mahāmattakathā senākathā bhayakathā
yuddhakathā annakathā pānakathā vatthakathā sayanakathā mālākathā
gandhakathā ñātikathā yānakathā gāmakathā nigamakathā nagarakathā
janapadakathā itthikathā purisakathā surākathā visikhākathā
kumbhaṭṭhānakathā pubbapetakathā nānatthakathā lokakkhāyikā
samuddakkhāyikā itibhavābhavakathā iti vā iti evarūpiṃ kathaṃ na
kathessāmiti._

(...) But, Ānanda, in regard to that talk which is helpful for erasing
defilements, which helps free the mind from the five hindrances, and which
leads to complete disillusionment [with originated phenomena], to
non-attachment [to originated phenomena], to the ending [of originated
phenomena], to inward peace, to transcendent insight, to enlightenment, and to
the Untroubled

_Yā ca kho ayaṃ ānanda kathā abhisallekhikā cetovinīvaraṇasappāyā
ekantanibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya upasamāya abhiññāya sambodhāya
nibbānāya saṃvattati._

(...) That is to say: talk about fewness of needs, talk about contentment, talk
about physical seclusion, talk about remaining aloof [from householders and
ascetics alike], talk about the exertion of energy, talk about moral habit,
talk about inward collectedness, talk about penetrative discernment, talk about
liberation [from perceptually obscuring states], talk about the knowledge and
vision that follows liberation [from perceptually obscuring states], he thinks:
'I will utter speech like this.'

_Seyyathīdaṃ appicchakathā santuṭṭhikathā pavivekakathā
asaṃsaggakathā viriyārambhakathā sīlakathā samādhikathā paññākathā
vimuttikathā vimuttiñāṇadassanakathā iti evarūpiṃ kathaṃ
kathessāmīti._
____

This shows that the ideal bhikkhu is, in fact, quite willing to converse for
the sake of religious inspiration. We have seen, for a similar purpose, with
the lay-followers of Pāṭaligāma, that the Buddha would be even willing to
talk 'far into the night.' So, again, to say that the Buddha's sermons were
'invariably concerned with dismissing' his audience is hardly justified.

===== Uyyojeti: other contexts

We have already noted that _uyyojeti_ can mean 'to incite, instigate, inspire,
persuade.' It occurs in these meanings in the following passages:

1. When the bhikkhunī Thullanandā arranged for a layman to be punished, that
layman had a dwelling made for the Ājīvaka ascetics close to the nunnery, and
instigated (_uyyojesi_) those ascetics, saying: "Denigrate these nuns."
+
****
_Atha kho so puriso daṇḍito bhikkhunūpassayassa avidūre ājīvakaseyyaṃ
kārāpetvā ājīvike uyyojesi. Etā bhikkhuniyo accāvadathā ti_ (Vin.4.224).
****

2. When a prostitute refused to visit a group of men, one of them suggested
that Master Udāyī should be told about it. He would surely persuade her
(_ayyo udāyī uyyojessatī ti_). So they told Udāyī that it would be good if
he persuaded the prostitute (_taṃ vesiṃ uyyojetu t_). When Udāyī
questioned the prostitute, she complained she did not know the men. Udāyī
told her 'Go with them. I know them' (_Gacchimesaṃ ahaṃ ime jānāmī_)
(Vin.3.138).

3. When a bhikkhunī refused to accept food from a man who was in love with
her, because it would have been an offence for her to do so, another bhikkhunī
persuaded her (_uyyojeti_) to accept it, saying 'What can this man do to you,
since you are not in love with him? Please accept and eat the food this man is
offering' (Vin.4.235).

According to these meanings of _uyyojeti_, _aññadatthu
uyyojanikapaṭisaṃyuttaṃyeva kathaṃ kattā hoti_ would mean a bhikkhu is
one whose words are exclusively connected with inciting, instigating,
inspiring, or persuading. Which is meaningless. Inciting what? Persuading what?

===== Brahmāyu Sutta: gladdening an audience with talk exclusively connected with the teaching

[quote, M.2.139]
____
To elicit a reasonable solution to this question, we will consider the
_Brahmāyu Sutta_ (M.2.139) which says that after eating the meal, the Buddha
instructs, inspires, rouses, and gladdens the audience with talk exclusively
connected with the teaching.

_aññadatthu dhammiyāva kathāya taṃ parisaṃ sandasseti samādapeti
samuttejeti sampahaṃseti._
____

Here _aññadatthu_ is now connected to _dhammiyāva kathāya sandasseti
samādapeti samuttejeti sampahaṃseti._ We take this phrase to be synonymous
with _aññadatthu uyyojanikapaṭisaṃyuttaṃyeva kathaṃ kattā hoti_
because it occurs in a similar context_._ In other words, if a bhikkhu
instructs, inspires, rouses, and gladdens his audience with talk exclusively
connected with the teaching, then he is 'one whose words are exclusively
connected with religious inspiration.' This, then, is our rendering of the
phrase in question.

[quote, A.4.233]
____
'This teaching is for those who live secludedly, not for those given to the
enjoyment of company.' So it was said. In reference to what was it said?

_Pavivittassāyaṃ bhikkhave dhammo nāyaṃ dhammo saṅgaṇikārāmassā ti
iti kho panetaṃ vuttaṃ kiñcetaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ_

In this regard, the bhikkhu living secludedly may be visited by bhikkhus,
bhikkhunīs, laymen, laywomen, kings and kings' ministers, and non-Buddhist
ascetics and their disciples. In that case, the bhikkhu, mentally inclining,
verging, and drifting towards seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and
spiritually unwholesome factors], psychologically withdrawn [from sensuous
pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors], taking delight in the practice
of unsensuousness, is one whose words are exclusively connected with religious
inspiration.

- _aññā_: arahantship

- _aññā_: knowledge [of things according to reality]

- _aññā_: knowledge of

- _aññā_: understanding of

- _aññā_: realisation of

==== Introduction

===== Aññā: the knowledge of an arahant

_Aññā_ is defined in the dictionaries as follows:

- PED: 'knowledge, recognition, perfect knowledge, philosophic insight,
knowledge par excellence, viz. Arahantship, saving knowledge, gnosis'

- DOP: 'knowledge, philosophic insight, perfect knowledge, i.e. arahatship.'

In fact _aññā_ means to know that one has destroyed birth etc. This is clear
in the _Kaḷāra Sutta_, where the Buddha asks Venerable Sāriputta:

[quote, S.2.54]
____
-- 'If they were to ask you: "Through what state of deliverance (_kathaṃ
vimokkhā_) have you declared _aññā_ thus: 'I know that birth is destroyed;
the religious life has been fulfilled; what had to be done has been done; there
will be no further arising in any state of individual existence?" Being asked
thus, how would you answer?'

_Sace pana taṃ sāriputta evaṃ puccheyyuṃ kathaṃ vimokkhā pana tayā
āvuso sāriputta aññā vyākatā khīṇā jāti vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ
kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ nāparaṃ itthattāyāti pajānāmi ti. Evaṃ
puṭṭho tvaṃ sāriputta kinti vyākareyyāsī ti._
____

Thus, to declare _aññā_ is to declare 'I know that birth is destroyed etc.'
This is equivalent to declaring arahantship. Therefore, with the support of
both dictionaries, this is our rendering for _aññā_: 'arahantship.'

===== Aññā: knowledge [of things according to reality]: Quote 1

The link between _aññā_ and _yathābhūta_ is seen in the following passage,
where our intention is to explain the parenthesis ('[of things according to
reality]'):

[quote, M.1.235]
____
On what grounds is a bhikkhu an arahant with perceptually obscuring states
destroyed, one who has fulfilled [the religious life], done what had to be
done, laid down the burden, achieved his objective, destroyed the ties to
individual existence, and is liberated [from perceptually obscuring states]
through the complete knowledge [of things according to reality]
(_sammadaññā_)?

_Kittāvatā pana bho gotama bhikkhu arahaṃ hoti khīṇāsavo vusitavā
katakaraṇīyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojano
sammadaññā vimutto ti?_

(...) In this regard, having seen any kind of bodily form... advertence according
to reality (_yathābhūtaṃ_) with perfect penetrative discernment as "not [in
reality] mine," "not [in reality] what I am," "not my [absolute] Selfhood," a
bhikkhu is liberated [from perceptually obscuring states] through being without
grasping.

_Idha aggivessana bhikkhu yaṃ kiñci rūpaṃ atītānāgata paccuppannaṃ
ajjhattaṃ vā bahiddhā vā oḷārikaṃ vā sukhumaṃ vā hīnaṃ vā
paṇītaṃ vā yaṃ dūre sannike vā sabbaṃ rūpaṃ n'etaṃ mama
n'eso'hamasmi na me so attā ti evametaṃ yathābhūtaṃ sammappaññāya
disvā anupādā vimutto hoti._
____

In this passage _yathābhūta_ has an object ('any kind of bodily form' etc),
and so, in accordance with our notes sv _Yathābhūta,_ we render it as
'according to reality.' But _aññā_ does not have an object, so we
parenthesise with _yathābhūta_, which we now translate as 'things according
to reality.' We discuss these two ways of rendering _yathābhūta_, sv
_Yathābhūta_.

===== Aññā: knowledge [of things according to reality]: Quote 2

The link between _aññā_ and _yathātathaṃ_ is seen in the following
passage, where our intention is again to explain the parenthesis ('[of things
according to reality]'):

[quote, Sn.v.732-3]
____
Recognising this danger, that suffering arises dependent on karmically
consequential deeds, with the quelling of karmically consequential deeds, and
the ending of mental images, in this way is there the destruction of suffering.
Knowing this in accordance with truth (_yathātathaṃ_), those who see
rightly, who are blessed with profound knowledge, and who are wise through the
complete knowledge [of things according to reality], having overcome Māra's
tie [that ties one to renewed states of individual existence], they do not come
to renewed states of individual existence.

Sabbasaṅkhārasamathā saññānaṃ uparodhanā +

Sammaddasā vedaguno sammadaññāya paṇḍitā +
Abhibhuyya mārasaṃyogaṃ nāgacchanti punabbhavan ti._

- understanding (of something)

- realisation (of something)

==== Introduction

===== Aññāya: 'absolutive'

_Aññāya_ is the absolutive of _ājānāti_ (and also the instrumental of
_aññā_, not covered here). Collins says absolutives have also been called
gerunds or indeclinable participles, but says that none of these terms are
entirely appropriate (Pāli Grammar for Students). PED uses the term 'gerund.'
But 'absolutive' is now the term of choice by the Pāli Text Society. Calling
it 'gerund' was always inexplicable.

We deal with _ājānāti_ separately, sv _Ājānāti_.

===== The absolutive: Duroiselle

Duroiselle says:

- the absolutive always denotes an action completed before another, and may be
translated:

1. by the word 'having' followed by a past participle, as _gantvā_, having
gone; or

2. by the past tense followed by the conjunction 'and': _gantvā_, he went
and...':

For example:

[quote, "PGPL, para 618"]
____
He lifted it up, took it home, divided it into four parts and, practising
almsgiving and other good deeds, went according to his deeds.

_So taṃ ukkhipitvā gharaṃ netvā catudhā vibhajitvā dānādīni
puññāni katvā yathākammaṃ gato.._
____

Duroiselle translates _katvā_ as a present participle ('practising') but stays
true to the rule that 'the absolutive always denotes an action completed before
another.' But he should have said 'usually denotes' because he then admits that
_idha āgantvā ahaṃ coraṃ passiṃ_ can be rendered 'Coming here I saw the
thief' (PGPL, para 618 (vi).

=== Aṇḍabhūta

==== Renderings

- _aṇḍabhūta_: enveloped [in uninsightfulness into reality]

- _aṇḍabhūta_: enveloped [in ailments]

==== Introduction

===== Aṇḍabhūta: occurrences

_Aṇḍabhūta_ occurs five times in the scriptures in just two phrases.
Firstly, in relation to the manyfolk who are void of insight into reality
(_avijjāgatā bhikkhave pajā aṇḍabhūtā pariyonaddhā_ (A.2.131) and
secondly in relation to bodily illness (_āturohāyaṃ gahapati kāyo
aṇḍabhūto pariyonaddho_, S.3.1). In both senses it occurs with
_pariyonaddho_, smothered (pp. of _pariyonandhati_).

===== Aṇḍabhūto: born of eggs

Although _aṇḍabhūto_ means being enveloped [in uninsightfulness into
reality] or enveloped [in ailments], like a chick within an eggshell, it could
be taken as 'become of an egg.' But that would lead to the unpleasant prospect
of explaining how the body or the manyfolk could be legitimately be called
egg-born, as more than one translator has said: the Buddha pierced the shell of
ignorance 'for the sake of creatures going in ignorance, born of eggs.'

===== Aṇḍabhūto: explanations

Bodhi says it could be a misspelling of _addabhūto_ ('weighed down'), and says
the commentary suggests 'become weak like an egg' (CDB.1043 n.3). But its
association with _pariyonaddho_ (smothered) counts against this, and supports
our calling _aṇḍabhūto_ 'enveloped in or by.'

=== Aṭṭhikatvā

==== Renderings

- _aṭṭhikatvā_: as a matter of vital concern

==== Introduction

===== Aṭṭhikatvā: occurrences

_Aṭṭhikatvā_ occurs 39 times in the scriptures, in 38 times followed by
either _manasikatvā_ or _manasikaroti._ In one case it is linked to
_paṭipajjamāno._

===== Aṭṭhikatvā: not sluggishly

DOP says it means 'making something one's aim or object; paying attention.' But
the _Upavāna Sutta_ (S.5.76) does not support this because it occurs in the
phrase _aṭṭhikatvā manasikaromi no ca līnan ti._ Here _aṭṭhikatvā_
is opposed to _no ca līnaṃ_, which Bodhi translates as 'I attend as a matter
of vital concern, not sluggishly.'

===== Aṭṭhikatvā equals nisamma

Bodhi's rendering 'as a matter of vital concern' is supported by Sn.v.317 where
_aṭṭhikatvā_ is a synonym of _nisamma_ ('carefully, considerately,
observing': PED). Here again _aṭṭhikatvā_ seems well rendered as 'as a
matter of vital concern.' The verse is as follows:

[quote, Sn.v. 317]
____
The wise and diligent man who associates with such a person (described in the
preceding verse), carefully (_nisamma_) practising in accordance with the
teaching as a matter of vital concern (_tadaṭṭhikatvāna_), becomes
knowledgeable, astute, and intelligent.

____

There are two forms of _maya_ that cannot be rendered by this scheme:
_atammayo_ and _sīlamayo_.

===== Atammayo

_Atammayo_ means literally 'not made of or produced by that.' Its actual
meaning is uncertain. Horner calls _atammayataṃ_ lack of desire (MLS.3.92).
Bodhi calls it non-identification (MLDB.911). The suttas show it means freedom
from ego.

===== Atammayo and the perception of the voidness of personal qualities in all originated phenomena: Ukkhittāsika Sutta

The _Ukkhittāsika Sutta_ (A.3.444) (quoted next) says being _atammayo_
regarding the whole world [of phenomena] (_sabbaloke ca atammayo_) is one of
the benefits of establishing without limit the perception of the voidness of
personal qualities in all originated phenomena.

[quote, A.3.444]
____
When a bhikkhu sees six advantages it should be enough to inspire him to
establish [in himself] without limit the perception of the voidness of personal
qualities in all originated phenomena. What six?

_Cha bhikkhave ānisaṃse sampassamānena alameva bhikkhunā
sabbasaṅkhāresu anodhiṃ karitvā anattasaññaṃ upaṭṭhāpetuṃ
katame cha:_
____

1. I will be free of the perception that "It is endowed with personal
qualities" regarding the whole world [of phenomena].
+
****
_Sabbaloke ca atammayo bhavissāmi_ (A.3.444).
****

Thus _atammayo_ is linked to the perception of the voidness of personal
qualities in all originated phenomena.

===== Atammayo and egotistical thought: Sappurisa Sutta

The _Sappurisa Sutta_ (M.3.42) says when the common person (_asappuriso_)
gains first jhāna, he thinks 'I am an attainer of the first jhāna; these
other bhikkhus are not.' But when a spiritually outstanding person
(_sappuriso_) gains jhāna, he thinks '_atammayatā_ even concerning the
attainment of the first jhāna has been spoken of by the Blessed One
(_paṭhamajjhānasamāpattiyāpi kho atammayatā vuttā bhagavatā_). Here
_atammayatā_ is the opposite of the egotistical thought 'I am an attainer of
the first jhāna.'

That _atammayatā_ is a queller of the ego is confirmed in this same passage
because the sutta continues: _yena yena hi maññati tato taṃ hoti
aññathā._ Horner renders this: 'for whatever they imagine it to be, it is
otherwise.' Bodhi says: 'for in whatever way they conceive, the fact is ever
other than that.'

But we have shown in this Glossary that _maññati_ is not just 'to think,' but
'to think of in personal terms.' Even the passage in hand already suggests
this, where the thoughts of the _asappuriso_, dominated by the word _ahaṃ_
are so obviously egotistical.

Therefore, in context, the words mean:

- _atammayo_: one who perceives that "It is void of personal qualities."

- _atammayataṃ_: the perception that "It is void of personal qualities."

===== Sīlamayo: 'comprised of virtue'

_Sīlamayo_ can mean 'comprised of virtue.' For example, there are three bases
for the generating of merit (_tīṇi puññakiriyavatthūni_ D.3.218. It.51).

1. The basis for the generating of merit comprised of generosity
+
****
_dānamayaṃ puññakiriyavatthu_
****

2. The basis for the generating of merit comprised of virtue
+
****
_sīlamayaṃ puññakiriyavatthu_
****

3. The basis for the generating of merit comprised of spiritual cultivation
+
****
_bhāvanāmayaṃ puññakiriyavatthu_ (D.3.218; It.51).
****

===== No sīlamayo: 'one who does not regard virtue as endowed with personal qualities'

However, the _Samaṇamaṇḍikā Sutta_ gives _sīlamayo_ a different
meaning. It proclaims a bhikkhu for being virtuous (_sīlavā hoti_) and adds
that he should also _no ca sīlamayo_ (i.e. _idha thapati bhikkhu sīlavā hoti
no ca sīlamayo_). Bodhi renders this 'a bhikkhu is virtuous but he does not
identify with his virtue (MLDB p.651). Horner says 'a monk is of moral habit
and has no addition to make to moral habit' (MLS.2.226). Let us consider it in
four steps:

1. if _atammayo_ means 'one who perceives that "It is void of personal
qualities,"' then

2. _tammayo_ means 'one who perceives that "It is endowed with personal
qualities"' and

3. _sīlamayo_ means 'one who regards virtue as endowed with personal
qualities,' and therefore

4. _no sīlamayo_ means 'one who does not regard virtue as endowed with
personal qualities.'

When the common person (_asappuriso_) gains first jhāna, he thinks 'I am an
attainer of the first jhāna; these other bhikkhus are not,' thereby glorifying
himself and disparaging others (_attānukkaṃseti paraṃ vambheti_). When a
spiritually outstanding person (_sappuriso_) gains jhāna, he thinks:

[quote, M.3.42-3]
____
The perception that "It is void of personal qualities" even concerning the
attainment of the first jhāna has been declared by the Blessed One.

_paṭhamajjhānasamāpattiyāpi kho atammayatā vuttā bhagavatā_

(...) Whatsoever one thinks of in personal terms, it is different than [how one
thinks of it].'

_yena yena hi maññanti tato taṃ hoti aññathā'ti_

(...) Therefore having prioritised the perception that "It is void of personal
qualities," he neither glorifies himself nor disparages others concerning the
attainment of first jhāna. This is the character of a spiritually outstanding
person.

- _attaniya_: what is [in reality] mine/his own/ours

- _attaniya_: what belongs to an [absolute] Selfhood

- _attaniya_: what could belong to an [absolute] Selfhood

- _attaniya_: [in reality] mine

- _anattaniya_: not [in reality] yours

==== Introduction

===== Attaniya: DOP vs. PED

Our renderings are close to DOP's 'belonging to', and far from PED's 'nature
of.'

1. DOP:

- _attaniya_ (adj): belonging to one's self, one's own; belonging to an
(enduring) self or soul.

- _attaniya_ (noun): what belongs to one's self; what belongs to an (enduring)
self or soul;

- _anattaniya_ (adj): not belonging to a self; not concerned with oneself.

2. PED:

- _attaniya_ (adj): 'of the nature of soul, soul-like'

- _attaniya_ (noun): 'anything of the nature of the soul'

===== You and yours are interchangeable

The Buddha compared the five aggregates to the sticks and grass of Jeta's Grove
which people carried off, burned, and made good use of (_jano hareyya vā
ḍaheyya vā yathāpaccayaṃ vā kareyya_). The Buddha asked the bhikkhus why
they did not think 'People are carrying us off, burning us, making good use of
us' (_amhe jano harati vā ḍahati vā yathāpaccayaṃ vā karotī ti_). The
bhikkhus said this was because with sticks and grass there was 'neither
ourselves nor what belongs to ourselves' (_na hi no etaṃ bhante attā vā
attaniyaṃ vā ti_). The Buddha concluded that each of the five aggregates 'is
not [in reality] yours. Abandon it' (_rūpaṃ... viññāṇaṃ bhikkhave na
tumhākaṃ. Taṃ pajahatha_).

So, whereas the question concerned people carrying 'us' off, the conclusion was
that the aggregates are 'not yours.' Thus 'you' and 'yours' are interchangeable
(M.1.141; S.3.34).

===== 'Could,' not 'would'

Horner's translation of M.1.138 reads:

[quote, "Horner, M.1.138"]
____
"If, monks, there were a Self, could it be said: 'It belongs to my self'?"

_attani vā bhikkhave sati attaniyaṃ me ti assā ti?._
____

Bodhi's translation reads:

[quote, "Bodhi, M.1.138"]
____
"Bhikkhus, there being a self, would there be for me what belongs to a self?
Or, there being what belongs to a self, would there be for me a self?"

_attani vā bhikkhave sati attaniyaṃ me ti assā ti? attaniye vā bhikkhave
sati attā me ti assā ti?._
____

He justifies this by saying there is a "mutual dependence" between the "twin
notions 'I' and 'mine'" (Bodhi, MLDB n.264).

But the first of his 'would's is not easily justified, and here we follow
Horner's 'could.' Our translation therefore reads:

[quote, M.1.138]
____
-- Bhikkhus, if there were an [absolute] Selfhood, could there be for me what
belongs to an [absolute] Selfhood?

_attani vā bhikkhave sati attaniyaṃ me ti assā ti?_

-- Yes, bhante.

-- If there were what belongs to an [absolute] Selfhood, would there be for me
an [absolute] Selfhood?

_attaniye vā bhikkhave sati attā me ti assā ti?_

-- Yes, bhante.

-- Bhikkhus, since neither an [absolute] Selfhood, nor what could belong to an
[absolute] Selfhood are apprehended as real and actual,

_attani ca bhikkhave attaniye ca saccato thetato anupalabbhamāne_

(...) then this view: 'The world [of phenomena] is my [absolute] Selfhood. Having
passed on, that I will be -- everlasting, enduring, eternal, of an unchangeable
nature; I will endure like unto eternity itself':

_yampidaṃ diṭṭhiṭṭhānaṃ so loko so attā so pecca bhavissāmi
nicco dhuvo sassato avipariṇāmadhammo sassatisamaṃ tatheva ṭhassāmī ti_

(...) is it not an utterly and completely foolish teaching?

the coil. As he unrolls the coil, he would not find even softwood, let alone
heartwood.

_So tattha pheggumpi nādhigaccheyya kuto sāraṃ._

Likewise, a bhikkhu does not consider the six senses to be either [in reality]

==== Introduction

===== The -paṭilābho suffix

Often _attabhāva_ is suffixed to become _attabhāvapaṭilābho_, which means:

- 'Assumption of an existence, becoming reborn as an individual' (PED sv
_Attan_).

- 'Obtaining a reincarnation, coming into existence' (PED sv _Paṭilābha_).

- 'The becoming reborn as an individual; reincarnation; type of body or
existence' (DOP sv _Attan_).

But -_paṭilābho_ is sometimes better treated as a past participle:

1. 'Acquired':
+
One of Venerable MahāMoggallāna's supporters was reborn in a mind-made body
(_aññataraṃ manomayaṃ kāyaṃ upapanno_), and his [newly] acquired
bodily form (_tassa evarūpo attabhāvapaṭilābho hoti_) was such that he
filled two or three Magadhan village fields, yet that [newly] acquired bodily
form harmed neither himself nor another (_so tena attabhāvapaṭilābhena

[quote, M.3.52]
____
Assumed individuality is of two kinds, I declare: to be fostered and not to be
fostered. And one's assumed individuality is either the one or the other. So it
was said by the Blessed One. And in reference to what was it said?

_Attabhāvapaṭilābhampahaṃ bhikkhave duvidhena vadāmi sevitabbampi
asevitabbampi. Tañca aññamaññaṃ attabhāvapaṭilābhan ti iti kho

Bhante, such an assumed individuality as causes spiritually unwholesome
factors to flourish and spiritually wholesome factors to fade in one who
fosters it should not be fostered

_yathārūpaṃ bhante attabhāvapaṭilābhaṃ sevato akusalā dhammā
abhivaḍḍhanti kusalā dhammā parihāyanti evarūpo attabhāvapaṭilābho

But such an assumed individuality as causes spiritually unwholesome factors to
fade and spiritually wholesome factors to flourish in one who fosters it should
be fostered.

flourish and spiritually wholesome factors to fade in one who fosters it?

_Kathaṃrūpaṃ bhante attabhāvapaṭilābhaṃ sevato akusalā dhammā

If, bhante, an assumed individuality that is hostile is brought into being,
unconducive to inner perfection, spiritually unwholesome factors flourish and
spiritually wholesome factors fade in him.

Four ways of acquiring a [particular] state of individuality.

_Cattārome bhikkhave attabhāvapaṭilābhā. Katame cattāro?_

There is the acquiring of a [particular] state of individuality
(_attabhāvapaṭilābho_) in which one's own intentionality has effect not
another person's (_attasañcetanā kamati no parasañcetanā_). Or another
person's, not one's own. Or both one's own and another person's. Or neither
one's own striving nor another person's (which is the case for devas of the
realm neither having nor lacking perception).

_Atthi bhikkhave attabhāvapaṭilābho yasmiṃ attabhāvapaṭilābhe

Venerable Sāriputta said this meant that where there is the acquiring of a

effect, not another person's, there is a passing away of beings from that group
on account of their own intentionality (_attasañcetanāhetu tesaṃ

=== Attā, Anattā

==== Renderings

- _attā_ (noun): ego

- _attā_ (noun): aspect of yourself

- _attā_ (noun): [absolute] Selfhood

- _attā_ (adjective): endowed with personal qualities

- _attā_ (pronoun): myself; yourself; himself; themselves; oneself

- _attā_ (stressed pronoun): he himself; you yourself

- _anattā_ (noun): the voidness of personal qualities [in things]

- _anattā_ (adjective): void of personal qualities

==== Introduction

===== Explaining unconditionality: Chachakka Sutta

The _Chachakka Sutta_ (M.3.282) says that the [co-conditional] arising and
disappearance of the six senses are discernable (_uppādo pi vayo pi
paññāyati_), and that he for whom [co-conditional] arising and disappearance
is discernable in something they regard as endowed with personal qualities
would be forced to the conclusion that 'My [absolute] Selfhood arises and
disappears' (_attā me uppajjati ca veti cā ti_). Thus the six senses are void
of personal qualities.

The arguments used in this and the two following paragraphs are only meaningful
if Selfhood is understood to be unconditional. Though _attā_ is commonly
rendered as 'Self' or 'soul' these renderings obscure the important
connotations of _anattā_: ungovernability, unlastingness and inherent
unsatisfactoriness. Hence our term '[absolute] Selfhood.'

===== Explaining unconditionality: Pañcavaggiya Sutta

The _Pañcavaggiya Sutta_ (S.3.66-7) says that if the five aggregates were
endowed with personal qualities they would not lead to affliction (_ābādhāya
saṃvatteyya_) and one could command them: 'Be thus! Be not thus!' One could
have them unconditionally according to one's will. The Buddha compared this to
a claim a king might make concerning 'his own realm' (_sakasmiṃ vijite_)
where he has the power to punish criminals as he wishes, but outside his realm
he has no such power (M.1.230). Likewise the five aggregates are outside one's
realm. They are ours conditionally not unconditionally. They cannot be regarded
as endowed with personal qualities because they do not accord unconditionally
with one's will.

===== Explaining unconditionality: Udāyī Sutta

In the _Udāyī Sutta_, Venerable Ānanda explained that _viññāṇa_ cannot
be regarded as endowed with personal qualities because it arises dependent on
conditions. If the indispensible and necessary conditions for _viññāṇa_
were to cease completely and totally without remainder (_so ca hetu so ca
paccayo sabbena sabbaṃ sabbathā sabbaṃ aparisesaṃ nirujjheyya_)
_viññāṇa_ would not be discerned. Thus _viññāṇa_ is conditional, not
unconditional. Therefore it is void of personal qualities (_viññāṇaṃ
anattā ti_ S.4.166).

===== Anattā (adjective): 'void of personal qualities'

As an adjective, _attā_ is rendered in this Glossary as 'endowed with personal
qualities,' and _anattā_ as 'void of personal qualities' because it is part of
the argument _yadanattā taṃ n'etaṃ mama n'eso'hamasmi na me so attā ti_
(S.4.1). This argument shows that _yadanattā_ has a meaning broad enough to
cover _n'etaṃ mama n'eso'hamasmi na me so attā ti._ It covers all terms:
"not [in reality] mine," "not [in reality] what I am," "not my [absolute]
Selfhood." Thus we say: What is void of personal qualities should be seen
according to reality with perfect penetrative discernment as "not [in reality]
mine," "not [in reality] what I am," "not my [absolute] Selfhood."

===== Parenthesis: [in reality]

The parenthesis '[in reality]' is justified because of _attā_'s link to
_yathābhūtaṃ_:

[quote, S.4.1]
____
What is void of personal qualities should be seen according to reality with
perfect penetrative discernment as "not [in reality] mine," "not [in reality]
what I am," "not my [absolute] Selfhood"

_yadanattā taṃ n'etaṃ mama n'eso'hamasmi na me so attā ti evametaṃ
yathābhūtaṃ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṃ._
____

Another example is this:

[quote, S.3.114]
____
He does not discern bodily form which is void of personal qualities according
to reality, thus: 'Bodily form is void of personal qualities.'

_anattaṃ rūpaṃ anattā rūpan ti yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti._
____

===== Inevitable link between the adjective and noun

The scriptures confirm the inevitable link between the adjective and noun:

1. For example, if something is _anattā_ (void of personal qualities,
adjective), it should be seen as not my _attā_ ([absolute] Selfhood, noun:
_yadanattā taṃ n'etaṃ mama n'eso'hamasmi na me so attā ti evametaṃ
yathābhūtaṃ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṃ_ S.4.1).

2. To say that the senses are _attā_ (endowed with personal qualities,
adjective) is untenable because their [co-conditional] arising and
disappearance are discernable and one would be forced to the conclusion that
'My _attā_ ([absolute] Selfhood, noun) arises and disappears (M.3.282-4).

===== Distinguishing adjectives and nouns

It is sometimes difficult to distinguish adjectives and nouns in the
scriptures; indeed, so difficult that DOP fails to recognise _attā_ as an
adjective at all. This is surprising. Not only does its predecessor, the PED,
recognise the adjective, but also the DOP itself (under _attan_) translates the
term _attatthaṃ_ (S.2.29) as 'one's own interest or profit' where 'one's own'
is adjectival. Bodhi also recognises that _attā_ in _attatthaṃ_ is an
adjective and translates it 'your own good.' However, at M.3.282 both he and
Horner do not recognise the adjective in the sentence _cakkhuṃ attā ti yo
vadeyya taṃ na upapajjati_. This would be naturally rendered as 'endowed with
personal qualities' but Bodhi and Horner render it as 'self':

- Bodhi: If anyone says, 'The eye is self,' that is not tenable.

- Horner: If anyone should say, 'Eye is self,' that is not fitting.

Although Ñāṇamoli agrees that _attā_ can be adjectival (in _Anattā
According to the Theravāda_) in the section on Derivation and Usage he
overlooks the adjective form, and in his translations in the same essay he
consistently calls it 'not self.' For example, he renders _rūpaṃ anattā_ as
'materiality is not self' where we would say 'is void of personal qualities.'
Therefore, it seems he considered the adjective form to be negligible.

===== Attā: paradoxical useage

Occasionally the Buddha used _attā_ in a paradoxical way.

____
He used it to indicate Ultimate Reality, one's [absolute] Selfhood, but in
conversation with young brahmans for whom this expression would be appropriate
and meaningful (Vin.1.23): 'What do you think, young men: which is better for
you: that you seek for a woman, or that you seek for your [absolute] Selfhood?

_katamaṃ nu kho tumhākaṃ varaṃ yaṃ vā tumhe itthiṃ gaveseyyātha
yaṃ vā attānaṃ gaveseyyāthā ti_
____

- He used it as a manner of speech, saying that bhikkhus should abide
spiritually self-reliant, and as refuges unto themselves (_attadīpo viharati
attasaraṇo_ D.2.100), which he explained meant practising
_satipaṭṭhānā_ and said that this was equivalent to abiding with the
teaching as one's island and refuge (_dhammadīpo dhammasaraṇo_).

- He said 'a bhikkhu does not let his unmastered self be mastered by suffering
(_bhikkhu na heva anaddhabhūtaṃ attānaṃ dukkhena addhabhāveti_ M.2.223).
It is consonant with the scriptures to take the advice as meaning that 'the
mind is intrinsically radiant: it is defiled by extrinsic defilements
(_pabhassaramidaṃ bhikkhave cittaṃ tañca kho āgantukehi upakkilesehi
upakkiliṭṭhanti_ (A.1.10). 'Unmastered self' is a manner of speech.

===== Suffix -atta: redundant

The suffix -_atta_ is usually redundant. For example, in _pahitatto_
('resolutely applied') and _sukhitattā_ ('happy') in these passages:

1. Enthusiastically applying himself [to the teaching], he scrutinises [it].
+
****
_ussahitvā tuleti_
****
+
[quote, M.1.480]
____
(...) Having scrutinised [it], he strives [to practise it].

_tulayitvā padahati_

(...) Being resolutely applied [to the practice] he realises with his very being
the supreme truth, and he sees [the nature of reality] having penetrated it
with discernment.

_pahitatto samāno kāyena ceva paramaṃ saccaṃ sacchikaroti paññāya ca
naṃ paṭivijjha passati._
____
+
Comment: Here _padahati_ is directly linked to its suffixed past participle,
where the suffix is clearly shown to be redundant.

2. May they be happy.
+
****
_bhavantu sukhitattā_ (Sn.v.145).
****
+
Comment: PED (sv _Sukhita_) likewise calls _sukhitattā_ 'happy, easy.' Norman
says 'happy-minded.'

_Atta's_ role as a suffix is not noted in the Pāli grammar books, nor in the
dictionaries sv _Atta_, though Duroiselle says _pahitatto_ means 'resolute,
whose mind is bent upon, literally directed towards,' and _ṭhitatto_ means
'of firm mind' (PGPL, para 555). Neither DOP nor PED mention 'mind' as a
meaning of _atta_, but for _anavositatta_ DOP says 'whose mind has no firm
convictions,' and for _susamāhitatto_ (sv _su_) PED says 'of steadfast mind.'
PED adds 'will,' sv _Pahita,_ saying _pahitatta_ means 'of resolute will'. PED
also sometimes considers -_atta_ redundant, for example in rendering
_ṭhitatto_ as 'self-controlled, composed, steadfast,' and _sukhitatta_ as
noted above. But if -_atta_ means 'mind', then it is still redundant. What,
after all, is the difference between 'happy' and 'happy-minded'?

PED's collection of -_atta_ words is this:

_ubbilāvitatta_: rejoicing, exultancy, elation of mind

_katatta_: self-possessed, disciplined

_khematta_: one who is at peace

_gatatta_: self-perfected, perfect

_ṭhitatto_: self-controlled, composed, steadfast

_pahitatta_: of resolute will

_yatatta_: selfcontrolled, one whose heart is kept down

_rakkhitatta_: one who guards his character

_vadhatta_: self-destruction

_vimuttatta_: having an emancipated self

_saṃyatattaṃ_: having one's self restrained, self-controlled

_saṃvutatta_: self-controlled

_sukhitatta_: happy, easy

_susamāhitatto_: of steadfast mind

===== Parenthesising anattā

_Anattā_ usually has an object associated with it:

[quote, A.4.14]
____
He abides contemplating the voidness of personal qualities in all things.

_sabbadhammesu anattānupassī viharati._
____

[quote, A.5.109]

____
the perception of the voidness of personal qualities in all originated

should be parenthesised, sometimes not:

[quote, A.5.109]
____
And what, Ānanda, is the perception of the voidness of personal qualities

====

endowed with personal qualities
====

If bodily form was endowed with personal qualities (_rūpañca hidaṃ
bhikkhave attā abhavissa_) it would not lead to affliction (_ābādhāya
saṃvatteyya_) and it would be possible to demand of bodily form (_labbhetha
ca rūpe_): 'My bodily form: be thus! My bodily form: be not thus!' (_evaṃ me
rūpaṃ hotu evaṃ me rūpaṃ mā ahosī ti_). But because bodily form is
void of personal qualities it leads to affliction (_rūpaṃ anattā tasmā
rūpaṃ ābādhāya saṃvattati_) and it is not possible to demand of bodily
form: 'My bodily form: be thus! My bodily form: be not thus!' (S.3.66-7).

====
attā

himself; [absolute] Selfhood
====

Saccaka claimed that a person has the five aggregates as himself
(_rūpattāyaṃ purisapuggalo... viññāṇattāyaṃ..._ ). The Buddha asked
if Saccaka was claiming the khandhas were "my [absolute] Selfhood" (_rūpaṃ
me attā... viññāṇaṃ me attā ti_) and compared this to a claim a king
might make concerning his own realm (_sakasmiṃ vijite_), where he has the
power to punish criminals as he wishes. The Buddha asked whether Saccaka
exercised any such power over the five aggregates so as to command them 'Let
them be thus, or not thus' (_vattati te tasmiṃ rūpe... viññāṇe vaso
evaṃ me rūpaṃ... viññāṇaṃ hotu evaṃ me rūpaṃ...
viññāṇaṃ mā ahosī ti_). Saccaka agreed he did not (M.1.230).

====

To say that the visual sense is endowed with personal qualities is untenable
(_cakkhuṃ attā ti yo vadeyya taṃ na upapajjati_) because the
[co-conditional] arising and disappearance of the visual sense is discernable
(_cakkhussa uppādo pi vayo pi paññāyati_) and he for whom [co-conditional]
arising and disappearance is discernable, would be forced to the conclusion
that 'My [absolute] Selfhood arises and disappears' (_attā me uppajjati ca
veti cā ti_). Thus the visual sense is void of personal qualities (_iti
cakkhuṃ anattā_) (M.3.282; S.2.95).

The Buddha said there are three types of sense impression: pleasant,
unpleasant, and neutral (_sukhaṃ vedanaṃ... dukkhaṃ vedanaṃ...
adukkhamasukhaṃ vedanaṃ_). If anyone experiences these sense impressions
considering them to be "my [absolute] Selfhood" (_eso me attā ti_), then when
they cease he would have to hold that 'my [absolute] Selfhood has been
shattered' (_vyaggo me attā ti_). Therefore it is not suitable to hold sense
impression is "my [absolute] Selfhood" (_nakkhamati vedanā me attā ti
samanupassituṃ_) (D.2.67).

There was once a number of non-Buddhist ascetics living around Sāvatthī. And
they were of various dogmatic views, as follows:

Eternal are the [absolute] Selfhood and the world [of beings]

_sassato attā ca loko ca_

Not eternal

_asassato attā ca loko ca_

Both eternal and not eternal

_sassato asassato attā ca loko ca_

Neither eternal nor not eternal

_neva sassato nāsassato attā ca loko ca_

Produced by oneself are the [absolute] Selfhood and the world [of beings]

_sayaṃ kato attā ca loko ca_

Produced by another

_paraṃ kato attā ca loko ca_

Produced by oneself and another

_sayaṃ kato paraṅkato attā ca loko ca_

Produced by neither oneself nor another. They have arisen spontaneously

_asayaṃ kāro aparaṅkāro adhiccasamuppanno attā ca loko ca_

And they lived quarrelsome, cantankerous, contentious, stabbing each other with
verbal daggers.

When the ascetic Vacchagotta asked whether or not there is an [absolute]
Selfhood (_atthattā ti... natthattā ti_) the Buddha refused to answer,
because, as he later explained, if he had answered that:

____
There is an [absolute] Selfhood, this would have been siding with those
ascetics and Brahmanists who are eternalists.

_ye te ānanda samaṇabrāhmaṇā sassatavādā tesametaṃ laddhi abhavissa._

There is no [absolute] Selfhood, this would have been siding with those
ascetics and Brahmanists who are annihilationists.

_ye te ānanda samaṇabrāhmaṇā ucchedavādā tesametaṃ laddhi abhavissa._

There is an [absolute] Selfhood, "would this have been consistent on my part
with the arising of the knowledge that 'all things are void of personal
qualities'?"

_apinu me taṃ ānanda anulomaṃ abhavissa ñāṇassa uppādāya. Sabbe

here and there the karmic consequences of meritorious and demeritorious deeds;
and this [absolute] Selfhood of mine is everlasting, enduring, eternal, of an
unchangeable nature, and will endure like unto eternity itself._

==== Introduction

===== 30+ meanings

The many meanings of _attha_ are confounding. In DOP the word entry takes over
six columns. The PED gives it six major headings, each with alternatives, and
extracts nearly thirty possible meanings. This Glossary offers a comprehensible
solution. We render it in over thirty ways.

===== Artha/attha: via Illustrations and notes

_Attha_ has two different roots, _artha_ and _asta_.

1. _Asta/attha_ occurs as a prefix in terms such as _atthaṃ paleti,
abbhatthaṃ gacchanti_ (= _abhi+atthaṃ gacchanti_) and _atthaṅgamo_, all
of which can be rendered as 'vanish' or 'vanishing.' But these are covered
under _Atthaṅgama_, not here.

2. _Artha/attha_ is so complicated that we will explain it primarily by way of
illustrations and accompanying notes.

===== Attha: the problem of 'goal'

Although 'goal' is nowadays often used for _attha_, it is a newcomer. PED does
not mention it. DOP mentions it thirteen times but is unsettled about it,
because it always offers an alternative. For example:

- 'intent on the goal or meaning'

- 'expressing the meaning or goal'

- 'connected with the goal, or with what is beneficial,' and so on.

Norman, too, often uses 'goal,' but it is problematic. For example, consider
these two passages:

1. 'Quenching is not hard to attain for him who sees the goal, even though it
is very fine and subtle'
+
****
_Susukhumanipuṇatthadassinā... nibbānaṃ na hi tena dullabhanti_ (Norman,
Th.v.210).
****
+
But quenching (_nibbāna_) surely is the goal. So here we prefer to say that
the _attha_ he sees is not 'the goal' but 'the meaning of the teaching.' We
would therefore say:
+
- _Nibbāna_ is not hard to attain to for one who sees the very fine and subtle
meaning of the teaching.

2. 'There is no one who sees the subtle goal as well as you [the Buddha] do'
+
****
_Na c'atthi tulyo nipuṇatthadassī_ (Norman, Sn.v.377).
****
+
But this curiously suggests that the Buddha saw _nibbāna_ better than other
arahants. The solution, again, is that _attha_ means not 'goal' but 'meaning of
the teaching,' so the passage reads:
+
- There is no one who sees the subtle meaning of the teaching as well as you do.

===== Attho: supreme goal

When _attho_ means goal it always means _nibbāna_, which we call 'supreme
goal,' and indeed it is often called _uttamatthaṃ_ (Dh.v.386; It.10;
Sn.v.324) or _paramaṃ atthaṃ_ (Thī.v.93).

===== Atthavasaṃ: 'good reason'

The etymology of _atthavasaṃ_ is perplexing, but the dictionaries call it:

- DOP: 'reason, motive'

- PED: 'reasonableness, reason, consequence, cause.'

Bodhi likewise says 'reason,' for example:

[quote, "Bodhi, A.1.98"]
____
Bhikkhus, it is for these two reasons that the Tathāgata has established the
training rules for his disciples.

_dveme bhikkhave atthavase paṭicca tathāgatena sāvakānaṃ sikkhāpadaṃ

_Kiñca bhikkhave bhikkhu atthavasaṃ paṭicca uppannaṃ lābhaṃ

____

We call it 'good reason.'

===== Atthavasi: 'intent on [the development of] spiritual well-being'

_Atthavasi_ means:

- DOP: 'pursuing an aim'

- PED: 'bent on (one's) aim or purpose'

Bodhi says 'intent on the good':

[quote, "Bodhi, S.3.93"]
____
Clansmen intent on the good take up that way of life for a valid reason

If the community of bhikkhus, not having investigated that case, not having got

Comment:

If the bhikkhu knows neither the rule nor the rule analysis (_neva suttaṃ

(_atthaṃ asallakkhento_), he may conceal the meaning under the wording
(_vyañjanacchāyāya atthaṃ paṭibāhati_) (Vin.2.97).

Comment:

The bhikkhu conceals the meaning (_atthaṃ_) under the wording because he is
ignorant of the rule analysis (_suttavibhaṅgo_). Thus 'rule analysis'
(_suttavibhaṅgo_) equals 'the meaning of the rule' (_atthaṃ_).

I heard this was said by the Blessed One, the Arahant:

Abandon one thing, bhikkhus, and I guarantee you non-returnership. Which
one thing?

_Ekadhammaṃ bhikkhave pajahatha ahaṃ vo pāṭibhogo anāgāmitāya.
Katamaṃ ekadhammaṃ?_

Abandon one thing, bhikkhus, greed, and I guarantee you non-returnership.

_Lobhaṃ bhikkhave ekadhammaṃ pajahatha ahaṃ vo pāṭibhogo
anāgāmitāyā ti._

This is what the Blessed One said, and in connection with which he added:

_Etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca tatthetaṃ iti vuccati_

The greed on account of which greedy beings are reborn in the plane of
misery,

_Yena lobhena luddhāse sattā gacchanti duggatiṃ_

through the complete understanding of that greed, those with insight
abandon it.

_Taṃ lobhaṃ sammadaññāya pajahanti vipassino_

Having done so they never return to this [low] plane of existence again.

_Pahāya na punāyanti imaṃ lokaṃ kudācanan ti_

This, too, was what the Blessed One said, so I heard.

_Ayampi attho vutto bhagavatā iti me sutan ti._

Comment:

With verbs of saying, asking, etc _attho_ often means simply 'this' or 'that,'
says DOP. Here the opening statement is 'I heard this was said by the Blessed
One' (_vuttaṃ h'etaṃ bhagavatā... me sutaṃ_). _Etamatthaṃ_ and _ayampi

=== Atthaṅgama

==== Renderings

- _abbhatthaṃ gacchanti_: to vanish

- _atthaṃ paleti_: to vanish

- _atthaṅgama_: vanishing

==== Introduction

===== Asta/attha: 'vanish' or 'vanishing'

_Attha_ is two words with different roots, _artha_ and _asta_. The former
(_artha/attha_) is covered in the Glossary under _Attha_. The latter
(_asta/attha_) is examined here. It occurs in three terms:

1. _abbhatthaṃ gacchanti_ (= _abhi+atthaṃ gacchanti_)

2. _atthaṃ paleti_

3. _atthaṅgamo._

These all mean 'to vanish' or 'vanishing.'

[quote, A.3.237]

Whatever one hears of the Master Gotama's teachings... grief, lamentation,
physical pain, psychological pain, and vexation immediately vanish.

_tato tato sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā abbhatthaṃ gacchanti._
____

====
abbhatthaṃ gacchati

to vanish
====

If there arise in a bhikkhu unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome thoughts
connected with attachment, hatred, and undiscernment of reality, then he should
pay attention to the dynamic quality of those thoughts (_tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ
vitakkasaṅkhārasaṇṭhānaṃ manasikātabbaṃ_). As he does so, then
spiritually unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, hatred, and
undiscernment of reality are abandoned in him and vanish (_pahīyanti te
abbhatthaṃ gacchanti_) (M.1.121).

====
atthaṃ paleti

to vanish
====

Just as a flame tossed about by the force of the wind vanishes, and is beyond
the limits of conception, (_atthaṃ paleti na upeti saṅkhaṃ_) so a sage
liberated from denomination-and-body vanishes, and is beyond the limits of
conception (_evaṃ muni nāmakāyā vimutto atthaṃ paleti na upeti
saṅkhaṃ_) (Sn.v.1074).

This is explained as follows:

[quote, Sn.v.1076]
____
There is no measuring of one who has vanished;

_Atthaṅgatassa na pamāṇamatthi_

(...) That no longer exists in relation to which one might speak of him;

_Yena naṃ vajjuṃ taṃ tassa natthi._

===== Dictionaries: concurrence

The Pāli dictionaries broadly concur with the renderings given here, though
DOP says 'fixes the mind on' and 'supervise' and 'not undertaken' where we
prefer 'concentrate' and 'organise' and 'firmly reject.'

===== On ignoring the dictionaries

In translation, dictionary renderings are mostly ignored. For example,

1. Horner says bhikkhus were 'looking after' repairs where we would say
'organising' (Vin.2.159).

2. Bodhi says a shopkeeper 'diligently applies' himself to his work where we
would say he 'carefully concentrates' (_sakkaccaṃ kammantaṃ
adiṭṭhāti_) on it.

3. Norman often rejects the usual translations for the word. We accept his
'established' at Th.v.768, a rendering not noted in the dictionaries.

Suppose a foolish mountain cow -- foolish, incompetent, unknowledgeable about
roaming mountains, improficient -- were to think, 'How about if I ate grass I
have never eaten before and drank water I have never drunk before?' She would
lift her hind hoof without having firmly placed her front hoof and thus would
not go where she had never gone before. And neither would she safely return to
where she had come from.

In the same way, a bhikkhu -- foolish, incompetent, unknowledgeable about first
jhāna, improficient -- enters first jhāna but does not stick with that
[successful] meditation object (_so taṃ nimittaṃ na āsevati_), does not
develop it (_na bhāveti_), cultivate it (_na bahulīkaroti_), or properly
concentrate on it (_na svādhiṭṭhitaṃ adhiṭṭhāti_). The thought
occurs to him, 'How about if I entered second jhāna?' He is not able to so.
And when he tries to re-enter first jhāna he is not able to do that either.
This is called a bhikkhu who has slipped and fallen from both sides, like the
foolish mountain cow (A.4.418).

If the torpor is unabandoned, then perceiving the constant nature of reality

Should he organise the use of more than that, even if standing where there are
no crops (_tato ce uttariṃ appaharite pi ṭhito adhiṭṭhaheyya_), it is
an offence of pācittiya.

=== Adhimuccati

==== Renderings

- _adhimuccati_: to focus on

- _adhimuccati_: to be intent upon

- _adhimuccati_: to be decided about

==== Introduction: correcting the texts

===== Reading vimuccati as adhimuccati

Both VRI and BJT Pāli editions agree that the word sequence _cittaṃ
pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati_ is followed by either _vimuccati_ or
_adhimuccati_. In every case we prefer _adhimuccati_. The commentaries support
us in two cases. The readings are as follows:

- D.3.240: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_ (Commentary: _Na vimuccatī ti
nādhimuccati_).

- M.1.186: _santiṭṭhati adhimuccati_

- M.1.435: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_

- M.3.104: _santiṭṭhati adhimuccati_

- M.3.112: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_

- A.2.166: _santiṭṭhati adhimuccati_

- A.3.245: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_ (Commentary: _Na vimuccatī ti na
adhimuccati_).

- A.4.235: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_

- A.4.438-48: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_

===== Horner vs. Trenkner

Concerning the occurrence at M.1.435, Horner praises the reading _pakkhandati
pasīdati santiṭṭhati vimuccati_, saying:

- 'The compilers were right to vary the last of the four verbs' (note to
M.1.435).

However, she admits that in saying so she contradicts Trenkner, who 'says he
should have adopted' _adhimuccati_.

===== Bodhi: adhimuccati 'makes better sense'

Bodhi supports Trenckner. In notes to the _Aṅguttara_ references he says:

- 'Though all three editions here read _vimuccati_, Mp [commentary] glosses the
word with _adhimuccati_. The latter makes better sense to me. The manuscript
traditions, as well as printed editions, show irregular variations between
these two readings throughout the Nikāyas.' (note to A.3.245, NDB n.1206).

- Mp glosses _vimuccati_ here as "liberated from the opposing qualities"
(_paccanlkadhammehi ca vimuccati_). Since all three editions, with the support
of Mp [commentary], have _vimuccati_, I translate in conformity with this
reading, but I think it likely that the original reading was _adhimuccati_,
"resolved upon" or "focused on." As the text unfolds with respect to the
successive meditative attainments, in each case the bodhisatta is
_vimuccati/adhimuccati_ upon the attainment before he actually achieves it. In
such a context being "focused on" rather than "liberated in" makes better sense
(note to A.4.439, NDB n.1943).

===== Conclusion

At all references we read _adhimuccati._

=== Anaññaposin

==== Renderings

- _anaññaposin_: not supported by a patron

==== Introduction

===== Comprehending anaññaposin

_Anaññaposin_ occurs five times in the scriptures, and always in verse. It is
associated with bhikkhus who walk on uninterrupted almsround (called
_sapadānacārī_, M.1.30). This is an austere practice (_dhutaguṇa_,
Vin.3.15) according to which a bhikkhu visits all houses on an almsroute, and
therefore does not cultivate special supporters.

Comprehending _anaññaposin_ is confounded by the other meanings of _poseti_
and its derivatives. The PED, for example, suggests _anaññaposino_ means 'not
nourished by another' (see under _posin_). Norman calls it 'not supporting
others' (Sn.v.65). From this, we see the extent of the puzzle:

1. Question: Is _anaññaposino_ passive or active?

2. Question: Are bhikkhus on almsround not nourished by others?

3. Question: Do good bhikkhus not support others?

===== Objectives

In considering this issue, we will accomplish the following objectives:

1. We will review the meanings of _poseti_, and will show it means either to
nourish or take care of.

2. We will confirm that bhikkhus are supported by others.

3. We will confirm that it is meritorious to take care of others by sharing
one's almsfood with them.

4. We will show that _anaññaposin_ is a synonym of _attabhara_
('self-reliant'), and is therefore passive in meaning.

5. We will show that _anaññaposin_ is a synonym of _kule kule
appaṭibaddhacitto_, which means 'not emotionally bound to any particular
family.'

6. In conclusion, we will show that _anaññaposin_ means that a bhikkhu who
collects food on uninterrupted house-to-house almsround is not supported by a
patron, and has many admirable qualities. Even the devas envy such a bhikkhu.

===== Puṭṭha: nourished

_Puṭṭha_ is the past participle of _poseti_. Here it means 'to nourish':

[quote, Sn.v.831]
____
Like a hero nourished on royal food

_Sūro yathā rājakhādāya puṭṭho._
____

===== Posakā: feeding

_Posakā_ means 'feeding':

[quote, A.1.62]
____
Parents are of great help to their children, in nursing them, feeding them, and
showing them the world.

_bahukārā bhikkhave mātāpitaro puttānaṃ āpādakā posakā imassa
lokassa dassetāro._
____

===== Posa: support

_Posa_ is the absolutive of _poseti._ In the following passage it means 'to
support,' where 'difficult to support' could mean either financially difficult
to support, or emotionally difficult to support:

[quote, S.1.61]
____
Formerly, the bhikkhus lived happily, the disciples of Gotama. They sought
their almsfood without desire. They used their abodes without desire. Knowing
the world's unlastingness [according to reality], they put an end to suffering.

_Sukhajivino pure āsuṃ bhikkhū gotamasāvakā +
Anicchā piṇḍamesanā anicchā sayanāsanaṃ +
Loke aniccataṃ ñatvā dukkhassantaṃ akaṃsu te._

(...) But now, like headmen in a village, they make themselves difficult to
support. They eat and eat, and then lie down, infatuated with other people's
homes.

_Dupposaṃ katvā attānaṃ gāme gāmaṇikā viya +
Bhūtvā bhutvā nipajjanti parāgāresu mucchitā._
____

===== Poseti: to take care of

_Poseti_ means 'to take care of':

[quote, S.1.181-2]
____
Then the brahman who took care of his mother said to the Blessed One

_mātuposako brāhmaṇo bhagavantaṃ etadavoca._

-- Master Gotama, I seek almsfood righteously and thereby take care of my
parents. In doing so, am I doing my duty?_

_Ahaṃ hi bho gotama dhammena bhikkhaṃ pariyesāmi. Dhammena bhikkhaṃ
pariyesitvā mātāpitaro posemi. Kaccāhaṃ bho gotama evaṃkārī
kiccakārī homī ti?_

-- Certainly, brahman, in doing so you are doing your duty. One who seeks
almsfood righteously and thereby takes care of his parents begets much merit.

_Taggha tvaṃ brāhmaṇa evaṃkārī kiccakārī hosi. Yo kho brāhmaṇa
dhammena bhikkhaṃ pariyesati. Dhammena bhikkhaṃ pariyesitvā mātāpitaro
poseti. Bahuṃ so puññaṃ pasavatī ti._
____

===== Poseti: to take care of

Jīvaka, as a newborn baby, was discovered on a rubbish heap by Prince Abhaya,
who told his men:

[quote, Vin.1.269]
____
-- Well, sirs, take that boy to our women's quarters and give him to nurses to
be taken care of (_posetuṃ_).

_Tena hi bhaṇe taṃ dārakaṃ amhākaṃ antepuraṃ netvā dhātīnaṃ
detha posetun ti_

(...) The men took the boy to Prince Abhaya's women's quarters and gave him to
nurses saying, 'Take care of him' (_posethā_)

_taṃ dārakaṃ abhayassa rājakumārassa antepuraṃ netvā dhātīnaṃ
adaṃsu posethā ti._

(...) Because it was said of him 'He's alive,' they named him Jīvaka.

_Tassa jīvatī ti jīvako ti nāmaṃ akaṃsu_

(...) Because the Prince had him taken care of (_posāpito_), they called him
Komārabhacca.

_Kumārena posāpito ti komārabhacco ti nāmaṃ akaṃsu_

In due course, Jīvaka Komārabhacca approached Prince Abhaya, and asked:

-- Who, sire, is my mother? Who is my father?

_kā me deva mātā? Ko pitā ti_

-- Not even I, good Jīvaka, know your mother, but I am your father, for I had
you taken care of (_posāpito_).

_Ahampi kho te bhaṇe jīvaka mātaraṃ na jānāmi. Apicāhaṃ te pitā.
Mayāsi posāpito ti._
____

COMMENT

_Apicāhaṃ te pitā. Mayāsi posāpito ti_. Word play.

===== Synonym: attabharassa

_Anaññaposino_ is a synonym of _attabharassa_ ('self-reliant'), so it is
passive not active:

[quote, Ud.30]
____
The devas envy the bhikkhu who collects his food on almsround, who is
self-reliant, not supported by a patron, inwardly at peace, and continuously
mindful.

_Piṇḍapātikassa bhikkhuno attabharassa anaññaposino. +
Devā pihayanti tādino upasantassa sadā satimato ti._
____

Context: Venerable MahāKassapa walking on uninterrupted house-to-house
almsround in Rājagaha.

===== Not supported by a patron: not emotionally bound to any particular family

The following verse from the _Khagaggavisāṇa Sutta_ repeatedly shows that a
bhikkhu who is _anaññaposī_ has no patron. Of particular interest is the
link to _kule kule appaṭibaddhacitto._ The verse could be cynically
interpreted as saying that patrons are for greedy, self-indulgent bhikkhus who
do not walk on uninterrupted house-to-house almsround, and who are emotionally
attached to particular supporters:

[quote, Sn.v.65]
____
Having no greed for flavours, not self-indulgent, not supported by a patron,
walking on uninterrupted house-to-house almsround, not emotionally bound to any
particular family, one should live the religious life as solitarily as a
rhinoceros horn.

_Rasesu gedhaṃ akaraṃ alolo anaññaposī sapadānacārī +
Kule kule appaṭibaddhacitto eko care khaggavisāṇakappo._
____

===== Conclusion

1. We have reviewed the possible meanings of _poseti_, and shown it means
either to nourish or to take care of.

2. We have confirmed that bhikkhus are supported by others.

3. We have confirmed that it is meritorious to take care of others by sharing
one's almsfood with them.

4. We have showed that _anaññaposin_ is a synonym of _attabhara_
('self-reliant'), and is therefore passive in meaning.

5. We have shown that _anaññaposin_ is a synonym of _kule kule
appaṭibaddhacitto_, which means 'not emotionally bound to any particular
family.'

6. In conclusion, we have shown that _anaññaposin_ means that bhikkhu who
collects food on uninterrupted house-to-house almsround is not supported by a
patron, and has many admirable qualities. Even the devas envy such a bhikkhu.

=== Anaṇa

==== Renderings

- _anaṇa_: free of karmic debt

- _anaṇa_: debtlessness

==== Introduction

===== Etymology: aṇa and iṇa

_Aṇa_ occurs only as _anaṇa_. Its synonym is _iṇa_. _Sāṇo_ is
_sa+iṇo_ = 'not free of karmic debt.'

===== Karmic debt

Karmic debt is defined in this quote:

[quote, A.3.352]
____
He misconducts himself by way of body, speech, and mind. This, I declare, is
getting into karmic debt.

_kāyena duccaritaṃ carati vācāya duccaritaṃ carati manasā duccaritaṃ

____

===== Freedom from karmic debt

'Free of karmic debt' is illustrated in Aṅgulimāla's verse.

[quote, M.2.105]
____
While I undertook much karmically consequential conduct that leads to [rebirth
in] the plane of misery, yet its karmic consequence has reached me now. I enjoy
my food free of karmic debt.

_Tādisaṃ kammaṃ katvāna bahuṃ duggatigāminaṃ; +
Phuṭṭho kammavipākena anaṇo bhuñjāmi bhojanaṃ._

===== Debtlessness

The meaning 'debtlessness' is seen in this passage:

[quote, A.2.69]
____
And what is the pleasure of debtlessness?

_Katamañca gahapati anaṇasukhaṃ?_

... In this regard a noble young man owes no debt great or small to anyone.
At the thought: I owe no debt, great or small, to anyone, physical and
psychological pleasure come to him. This, householder, is called the pleasure
of debtlessness.

_Idha gahapati kulaputto na kassaci kiñci dhāreti appaṃ vā bahuṃ vā. So

=== Anamatagga

==== Renderings

- _anamatagga_: long-lasting beyond conception

- _anamatagga_: endless beyond conception

==== Introduction

===== Anamatagga: uncertain derivation

_Anamatagga_ has long been a source of controversy. The difficulty of the word
is acknowledged by PED when it says: 'The meaning can best be seen, not from
the derivation (which is uncertain), but from the examples quoted.'

===== Translators' renderings

Translators render it in the following ways:

[quote, "Norman, Thī.v.496"]
____
'The journeying-on as being without beginning and end'

_saṃsāraṃ anamataggato._
____

[quote, "Bodhi, S.5.441"]
____
'This _saṃsāra_ is without discoverable beginning'

_anamataggoyaṃ bhikkhave saṃsāro._
____

Thus _anamatagga_ potentially means:

1. endless

2. beginningless

3. without discoverable beginning

We will now show the problem of these terms, and we will show why we follow
PED's 'whose beginning and end are alike unthinkable,' and the commentary's (ad
S.2.178) _aparicchinnapubbāparakoṭikoti attho_ ('first and last point cannot
be determined').

===== Endlessness: the problem

1. The problem with calling the round of birth and death 'endless' is that
arahants have ended it, and others will follow. The most one could say is
'potentially endless' or 'perhaps endless for some.'

2. The second problem with calling the round of birth and death 'endless' is
that the Buddha did not quite say that when he said:

[quote, S.3.149]
____
There comes a time when the great ocean dries up, evaporates, and exists no
more, but not, I declare, an ending of suffering for beings roaming and
wandering the round of birth and death, [obstructed by] uninsightfulness into
reality, and [tethered to individual existence] by craving.

_Hoti kho so bhikkhave samayo yaṃ mahāsamuddo ussussati visussati na bhavani
na tvevāhaṃ bhikkhave avijjānīvaraṇānaṃ sattānaṃ
taṇhāsaṃyojanānaṃ sandhāvataṃ saṃsarataṃ dukkhassa antakiriyaṃ
vadāmi._
____

To say that beings will continue to suffer as long as they wander the round of
birth and death, is not to say that the round of birth and death is endless.

===== Beginningless: the problem

The problem with calling the round of birth and death 'beginningless' is that
the Buddha again did not quite say that when he said 'a first point is not to
be discerned' (_pubbā koṭi na paññāyati,_ S.2.181).

===== Without discoverable beginning: the problem

The problem with saying _anamataggoyaṃ_ means '_saṃsāra_ is without
discoverable beginning' is that sometimes _anamataggoyaṃ_ is used in
reference to the future. For example, the _Sattisata Sutta_ (S.5.441) says a
man may be offered the opportunity to penetrate the four noble truths on the
condition that he agrees to receive 300 spear wounds a day for a hundred years.
Then the sutta says:

[quote, S.5.441]
____
It would be fitting for a noble young man intent on [the development of his
own] spiritual well-being to accept the offer. For what reason? Because the
round of birth and death is _anamatagga_. A first point is not to be discerned
of [a receiving of] blows by knives, swords, arrows, and axes.

_Atthavasikena bhikkhave kulaputtena alaṃ upagantuṃ. Taṃ kissa hetu?
Anamataggoyaṃ bhikkhave saṃsāro pubbā koṭi na paññāyati
sattippahārānaṃ asippahārānaṃ usuppahārānaṃ pharasuppahārānaṃ_
____

The logic for accepting the offer would be that _saṃsāra_ is 'without
discoverable end,' not 'without discoverable beginning.'

===== Anamatagga: etymology

_Anamatagga_ is etymologically _ana_ (= a neg.) + _mata_ (fr. _man_) + _aggā_
(pl.) (PED), which have the following meanings:

- _mata_ is the past participle of _maññati_, meaning 'thought, understood,
considered.' From this we call _anamata_ 'beyond conception.'

- _Agga_ means 'the very tip, the very end' (DOP sv _Agga1_).

- PED takes _agga_ as _aggā_ (plural) and translates the term 'whose beginning
and end are alike unthinkable.' DOP says 'without beginning (or end).'

- That _agga_ can mean 'beginning' is seen in the term _aggena_ ('in the
beginning, beginning from, from,' PED sv _Agga1_) and _aggañña_ ('recognized
as primitive primeval').

[quote, Vin.2.95]
____
That _agga_ can mean 'end' is seen here: 'While bhikkhus are investigating that
legal matter endless brawls arise.

_Tehi ce bhikkhave tasmiṃ adhikaraṇe vinicchiyamāne anaggāni ceva
bhassāni jāyanti._
____

If _ana-aggā_ means 'without beginning or end,' it means 'long-lasting.' This
is supported by quotes where the adjective is 'long': _Dīgho vo saṃsāro_
(Thī.v.474).

===== Anamatagga: endless beyond conception

Where the object is not the round of birth and death, we say 'endless beyond
conception':

[quote, Thī.v.495]
____
For the fool, the round of birth and death is [truly] long-lasting, weeping
again and again over the deaths of his fathers, the killings of his brothers,
and the punishments of himself, which are endless beyond conception.

_Dīgho bālānaṃ saṃsāro punappunañca rodataṃ +
Anamatagge pitumaraṇe bhātuvadhe attano ca vadhe._
____

[quote, S.2.181-2]
____
So long is the period of a universal cycle, bhikkhu. And of universal
cycles of such length, we have wandered the round of birth and death for the
periods of so many universal cycles, so many hundreds of universal cycles, so
many thousands of universal cycles, so many hundreds of thousands of universal
cycles. For what reason?

_Evaṃ dīgho kho bhikkhu kappo. Evaṃ dīghānaṃ kho bhikkhu kappānaṃ
neko kappo saṃsito nekaṃ kappasataṃ saṃsitaṃ nekaṃ kappasahassaṃ
saṃsitaṃ nekaṃ kappasatasahassaṃ saṃsitaṃ. Taṃ kissa hetu?_

Because, bhikkhu, the round of birth and death is long-lasting beyond
conception.

_Anamataggoyaṃ bhikkhu saṃsāro_

A first point is not to be discerned of beings [obstructed by] uninsightfulness
into reality, and [tethered to individual existence] by craving, roaming and
wandering the round of birth and death.

[quote, S.2.178]
____
Suppose a man cut up whatever grass, sticks, branches, and foliage there are in
this great subcontinent and collected them into a single heap of sticks four
fingerbreadths long, and placed them down one by one, saying:

_Seyyathā pi bhikkhave puriso yaṃ imasmiṃ jambudīpe
tīṇakaṭṭhasākhāpalāsaṃ taṃ chetvā ekajjhaṃ saṃhareyya
ekajjhaṃ saṃharitvā caturaṅgulaṃ caturaṅgulaṃ ghaṭikaṃ
karitvā nikkhipeyya_

'This is my mother, this my mother's mother.'

_ayaṃ me mātā tassā me mātu ayaṃ mātā ti_

The sequence of that man's mothers, and mothers of mothers, would not be
exhausted, yet the grass, wood, branches, and foliage in this great
subcontinent would be finished and exhausted. For what reason?

_Apariyādinnāva bhikkhave tassa purisassa mātu mātaro assu. Atha imasmiṃ
jambudīpe tiṇakaṭṭhasākhāpalāsaṃ parikkhayaṃ pariyādānaṃ
gaccheyya. Taṃ kissa hetu?_

Because the round of birth and death is long-lasting beyond conception. A first
point is not to be discerned of beings roaming and wandering the round of birth
and death, [obstructed by] uninsightfulness into reality, and [tethered to
individual existence] by craving.

=== Anicca; Nicca

==== Renderings

- _nicca_: everlasting

- _nicca_: lasting

- _nicca_: constantly

- _anicca_: unlasting

- _anicca_: unlastingness

==== Introduction

===== Step-by-step change

_Anicca_ concerns change that is either step-by-step or continuous. For
example, the _Sattasuriyuggamana Sutta_ (A.4.100) describes seven successive
disasters that will step-by-step destroy Planet Earth. Firstly the vegetation
will be destroyed, then the rivers and lakes, the oceans, the mountains, and
finally the planet itself. Each destructive step is said to illustrate _anicca_
(_evaṃ aniccā bhikkhave saṅkhārā_).

[quote, A.4.101]
____
Bhikkhus, there comes a time when for many hundreds and thousands of years
there is no rain. Without rain, all grass and vegetation, all trees yielding
medicine, all the palms and giants of the jungle become parched and dried up
and are no more. Thus unlasting are originated phenomena.

_evaṃ aniccā bhikkhave saṅkhārā._
____

===== Continuous change

More usually, however, _anicca_ refers to a continuous process, where the
practice involves the uninterrupted observation of change. For example:

[quote, A.4.13]
____
Some person abides contemplating unlastingness in relation to all
originated phenomena, perceiving unlastingness, experiencing unlastingness

_idhekacco puggalo sabbasaṅkhāresu aniccānupassī viharati
aniccasaññī aniccapaṭisaṃvedī_

continuously

_satataṃ_

without a break

_samitaṃ_

uninterruptedly

_abbokiṇṇaṃ_

intent upon it mentally

_cetasā adhimuccamāno_

penetrating it with penetrative discernment

_paññāya pariyogāhamāno._
____

We illustrate this idea with the following quote:

[quote, S.2.266]
____
As swift as are the sun and moon, and as swift as are the devas that run before
the sun and moon, the factors essential to life perish even more swiftly than
that. Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abide
diligently applied [to the practice]'

_yathā ca candimasuriyānaṃ javo yathā ca yā devatā candimasuriyānaṃ
purato dhāvanti tāsaṃ devatānaṃ javo tato sīghataraṃ āyusaṅkhārā
khīyanti. Tasmātiha bhikkhave evaṃ sikkhitabbaṃ appamattā viharissāmā
ti._
____

===== The problem of 'impermanent'

_Anicca_ is usually termed 'impermanent.' And if permanent means 'continuing or
enduring without fundamental or marked change' (Webster's), then impermanent
means continuing or enduring with fundamental or marked change. In which case,
permanence means lastingness without change, and impermanence means lastingness
with change. But the concept that things last, continue, or endure to the
slightest degree is not supported by the scriptures.

1. Firstly, we have noted that _anicca_ is continuous and uninterrupted, and
this discounts any degree of lastingness.

2. Secondly, there are three marks of the originated.
+
****
_Tīṇi'māni bhikkhave saṅkhatassa saṅkhatalakkhaṇāni_
****

[quote, A.1.152]
____
an arising is discernable

_uppādo paññāyati_

a disappearance is discernable

_vayo paññāyati_

a changeability while persisting is discernable

_ṭhitassa aññathattaṃ paññāyati._
____

The idea of 'changeability while persisting' again negates any possibility of
lastingness. Hence 'impermanence' is unsatisfactory for this reason.

===== Nicca: lasting and everlasting

_Nicca_ stems from _ni_, which means 'downward'=onward, on and on, says PED. We
give it two meanings corresponding with the two meanings for _anicca_.

1. When we call it 'everlasting', it is commonly linked to 'eternal':
+
[quote, M.1.138]
____
Having passed on, that I will be -- everlasting, enduring, eternal, of an
unchangeable nature; I will endure like unto eternity itself':

_so pecca bhavissāmi nicco dhuvo sassato avipariṇāmadhammo sassatisamaṃ

In the past this Mount Vepulla was called Pācinavaṃsa, and the people were
called Tivaras whose lifespan was 40,000 years. They could climb Mount
Pācinavaṃsa in four days and descend in four days. At that time the Blessed
One Kakusandha, arahant, perfectly enlightened, had arisen in the world. His
two chief disciples were named Vidhura and Sañjīva, an excellent pair. Now
see, bhikkhus! That mountain's name has disappeared, those people have died,
and that Blessed One has passed away to the Untroubled-without-residue.

Thus unlasting are originated phenomena, thus unenduring are originated
phenomena, thus unconsoling are originated phenomena. It is time enough,
bhikkhus, to be disillusioned with all originated phenomena, to be unattached
to them, to be liberated from them.

===== Etymology: a+nīgha not a+īgha

The scriptures show that _anīgha_ is _a+nīgha_ not _a+īgha_. For example,
the _Kāmabhu Sutta_ (S.4.292) says the arahant is called _anīgho_ because he
has abandoned _rāgo nīgho, doso nīgho, moho nīgho_:

[quote, S.4.292]
____
Attachment, hatred, and undiscernment of reality are spiritual defilements

_rāgo kho bhante nīgho doso nīgho moho nīgho_

(...) The arahant has abandoned them, chopped them down at the root, completely
and irreversibly destroyed them, so they will never arise again in future,
therefore the arahant is called 'one who is rid of spiritual defilement'_

_te khīṇāsavassa bhikkhuno pahīnā ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā
anabhāvakatā āyatiṃ anuppādadhammā tasmā khīṇāsavo bhikkhu anīgho
ti vuccati._
____

===== Nīgha means rāgo, doso and moho

The _Kāmabhu Sutta_ also therefore shows that _nīgha_ means _rāgo, doso,_
and _moho._

===== Nīgha means spiritual defilement

Other suttas show the meaning of _anīgha_ is broader than that, showing that
_nīgha_ means spiritual defilement.

1. The _Uraga Sutta_, quoted more fully below, links it to the abandonment of
the five hindrances (_yo nīvaraṇe pahāya pañca anīgho_).

2. Other suttas associate _anīgha_ with freedom from, for example, longing
(_nirāsaṃ_), doubt (_saṃsayaṃ_) and attachment (_asitaṃ;
chinnaganthaṃ; saṃyojanabandhanacchidā_). See Illustrations.

Therefore _nīgha_ means any kind of spiritual defilement.

===== Anīgha means 'rid of spiritual defilement'

If _anīgha_ means freedom from a broad range of spiritual defilements through
their being abandoned, chopped down at the root, completely and irreversibly
destroyed, so they will never arise again in future, it is properly represented
by the phrase 'rid of spiritual defilement.'

===== Spellings, anīgha and anigha

There are two spellings: _anīgha_ and _anigha_, but _anīgha_ seems more
orthodox. _Anigha_ occurs only in verse, suggesting that _anīgha_ becomes
_anigha_ for metrical purposes. Indeed, DOP says _anīgha_ is 'usually
unmetrical.'

____

Comment:

I accept PTS spellings here. I take _anigha_ as standing for _anīgha_ because
DOP says _anīgha_ is usually unmetrical_._ I take _aghaṃ_ to mean _nigha_
because the passage itself does so.

Although these readings are unsettled, other readings do no better in
explaining the nature of the conversation here. Bodhi renders the word as
'untroubled' throughout.

=== Anuneti

==== Renderings

- _anunīta_: motivated

- _anunīta_: attracted

- _anunaya_: attraction

- _anuneti_: to conciliate

- _anunetā_: diplomat

- _anunayasaṃyojanaṃ_: attraction [to sensuous pleasure], as a tie to
individual existence

==== Introduction

===== Anunaya: 'leading along'

_Anunaya_ means 'leading along.'

===== Anunetar: 'diplomat'

_Anuneta(r)_ is 'one who leads or persuades or conciliates,' says DOP, so we
call it 'diplomat.'

===== Anunayasaṃyojanaṃ: attraction [to sensuous pleasure]

The second of the seven ties to individual existence (_sattannaṃ
saṃyojanānaṃ_ A.4.7-9) is repugnance, _paṭighasaṃyojanaṃ_. In
opposition to repugnance is the first of the seven ties,
_anunayasaṃyojanaṃ_ and we call this 'attraction.' This is in accordance
with the root idea 'leading along,' and it harmonises with 'inclination
towards,' a term suggested by DOP. But by 'attraction' we mean 'attraction [to
sensuous pleasure],' which we explain in three steps:

1. The seven ties to individual existence (_satta saṃyojanāni_) are:
_anunayasaṃyojanaṃ paṭighasaṃyojanaṃ diṭṭhisaṃyojanaṃ_ etc.

2. The seven unwholesome proclivities (_sattannaṃ anusayānaṃ_) are:
_kāmarāgānusayo paṭighānusayo diṭṭhānusayo_ etc.

3. In these lists _anunayasaṃyojanaṃ_ corresponds to _kāmarāgānusaya,_
the proclivity to attachment to sensuous pleasure. Hence we render
_anunayasaṃyojanaṃ_ as 'attraction [to sensuous pleasure]' not just
'attraction.'

===== Anuneti: to conciliate

That _anuneti_ means 'to conciliate' is clear in two illustrations below.

===== Anunīta

PED calls _anunīta_ (pp of _anuneti_) 'led, induced.' We prefer 'motivated' or
'attracted.'

=== Anusaya

==== Renderings

- _anusaya_: proclivity (to something)

- _anusaya_: unwholesome proclivity

- _anusaya_: identification

- _anuseti_: to lurk within

- _anuseti_: to identify with

- _anuseti_: to linger

==== Introduction

===== Anusaya: 'proclivity'

_Anusaya_ means tendency, but 'always in a bad sense,' says PED. The
_Madhupiṇḍika Sutta_ appropriately calls the _anusayas_ 'unvirtuous,
spiritually unwholesome factors' (_pāpakā akusalā dhammā_ M.1.109).
Accordingly, we call _anusayas_ 'proclivities' which means 'a strong natural
proneness, usually to something objectionable or evil' (Webster's).

===== Anuseti: 'lurk within' and 'linger'

_Anuseti_ means 'to lie down with.' Illustrations below show it can be called
'to lurk within' or 'to linger.' Relevant quotes are presented below.

===== Anuseti: 'identify with.'

In some circumstances _anuseti_ means 'to identify with.' This needs a
substantial explanation because it is unnoted by translators and lexicographers
alike.

===== 'To identify with': explanation

To show that _anuseti_ means 'to identify with,' we will use an argument that
includes the concept of 'being measured,' as follows:

1. Firstly, when we say 'to identify with' we mean 'to see things as "[in
reality] mine," or "[in reality] what I am," "my [absolute] Selfhood."'
+
****
_etaṃ mama eso'hamasmi eso me attā ti_.
****

2. Secondly, when the _Dutiya Bhikkhu Sutta_ says 'one is measured because of
_anuseti'_ (_yaṃ kho bhikkhu anuseti taṃ anumīyati_, S.3.36-7) we take
'measured' to mean 'measured against others via the three modes of
self-centredness.' These are the _tisso vidhā_, namely: 'I am better,' 'I am
equal,' 'I am worse' (S.5.56).

3. That 'being measured' comes from 'identifying with' is shown in the
_Surādha Sutta_, which says that transcending the modes [of self-centredness]
(_vidhā samatikkantaṃ_) is attained by not identifying with the five
aggregates, as follows:
+
[quote, S.3.80-1]
____
One perceives all bodily form... advertence according to reality with perfect
penetrative discernment as "not [in reality] mine," "not [in reality] what I
am," "not my [absolute] Selfhood"'

_sabbaṃ rūpaṃ... sabbaṃ viññāṇaṃ n'etaṃ mama n'eso'hamasmi na
me so attā ti._

(...) Thus knowing, thus seeing, in regard to this [wretched human] body together
with its advertence and all external phenomena, the mind is rid of the
illusions of personal identity and personal ownership and self-centredness, it
has transcended the modes [of self-centredness], and is peaceful and liberated
[from perceptually obscuring states].

_Evaṃ kho surādha jānato evaṃ passato imasmiñca saviññāṇake kāye
bahiddhā ca sabbanimittesu ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānāpagataṃ mānasaṃ
hoti vidhā samatikkantaṃ santaṃ suvimuttanti._
____

4. We have seen that the _Surādha Sutta_ says 'being measured' comes from
'identifying with,' and the _Dutiya Bhikkhu Sutta_ says being measured
(_anumīyati_) comes from _anuseti._ Therefore _anuseti_ means 'to identify
with.'

5. Accordingly, the _Dutiya Bhikkhu Sutta_ can be translated as follows:
+
[quote, S.3.36-7]
____
'What one identifies with, by that one is measured.'

_yaṃ kho bhikkhu anuseti taṃ anumīyati._
____

This makes perfect sense, and validates our argument.

===== Advantage: rational

Rendering _anuseti_ as 'to identify with' has two advantages. Firstly,
translations are rational, as for example here:

[quote, S.3.35]
____
Whatever one identifies with, one is reckoned in terms of.

_yaṃ kho bhikkhu anuseti tena saṅkhaṃ gacchati._
____

===== Advantage: congruous

The second advantage of translating _anuseti_ as 'to identify with' is that it
avoids the incongrous idea of 'having a tendency to the five aggregates.' For
example Bodhi says:

[quote, translation of S.3.36]
____
If, venerable sir, one has an underlying tendency towards form, then one is
measured in accordance with it

_Rūpaṃ ce bhante anuseti taṃ anumīyati._
____

This is incongruous, for the following reasons:

1. 'Tendency' goes with verbs and mental states, but not other nouns. For
example, a tendency to argue, to doubt, to anger etc.

2. Webster's dictionary accordingly says tendency means 'a proneness to a
particular kind of thought or action.'

3. The seven _anusaya's_ themselves follow this principle, with a list that
includes the proclivity to repugnance, to self-centredness etc. But no
'tendency to the five aggregates.'

Therefore when _anuseti_ is applied to nouns that are not mental states, we use
the verb 'to identify with,' and our comparable rendering for S.3.36 is:

[quote, S.3.36]
____
If, bhante, one identifies with bodily form, by that one is measured.

_Rūpaṃ ce bhante anuseti taṃ anumīyati._
____

===== Anusaya: same principle

The same principle holds for the noun _anusaya_. Rendering it 'proclivity'
makes good sense when it is linked to verbs and mental states. But when linked
to other types of nouns, we call it 'identification.' This avoids the obvious
problems of Bodhi's translations, where _anuseti_ is always 'underlying
tendency.' Let us compare translations of two quotes:

Quote 1)

Bodhi says:

[quote, "Bodhi, M.3.285"]
____
the underlying tendency to lust lies within one.

_Tassa rāgānusayo anuseti._
____

This translation is satisfactory because lust is a mental state. Our
translation of the quote is comparable:

[quote, M.3.285]
____
The proclivity to attachment lurks within him.

_Tassa rāgānusayo anuseti._
____

Quote 2)

Bodhi says:

[quote, "Bodhi, S.3.10"]
____
The desire, lust, delight, and craving, the engagement and clinging, the mental
standpoints, adherences, and underlying tendencies regarding the form element:
these have been abandoned by the Tathāgata.

_rūpadhātuyā kho gahapati yo chando yo rāgo yā nandi yā taṇhā ye
upayupādānā cetaso adhiṭṭhānābhinivesānusayā te tathāgatassa
pahīnā._
____

This quote involves a noun that is not a mental state ('underlying tendencies
regarding the form element'). We translate the passage with 'identification'
('identification in regards to bodily form') as follows:

[quote, S.3.10]
____
The fondness, attachment, spiritually fettering delight, craving, clinging,
grasping, obstinate adherence, stubborn attachment, and identification in
regards to bodily form have been abandoned by the Perfect One

_rūpadhātuyā kho gahapati yo chando yo rāgo yā nandi yā taṇhā ye
upayupādānā cetaso adhiṭṭhānābhinivesānusayā te tathāgatassa
pahīnā._
____

===== Conclusion

In conclusion, where they involve nouns that are not mental states, _anusaya_
and _anuseti_ mean 'identification' and 'to identify with.'

=== Antagū

==== Renderings

- _antagū_: one who has reached the end of

==== Introduction

===== Antagū: reached the end of

_Antagū_ means 'one who has reached the end (of something),' and is therefore
usually qualified. For example: 'the end of the spiritual path'
(_paṭipadantaguṃ_) or 'the end of suffering' (_dukkhantagunā_), and so on.

===== Lokantagū: reached the end of the world [of phenomena]

_Lokantagū_ means 'one who has reached the end of the world.' _Loka_ is dealt
with in detail elsewhere in the Glossary, but in conclusion we take 'world' as
'world [of phenomena].'

===== Vedantagū: completed his scriptural education

_Vedantagū_ means 'reached the end of scriptural knowledge,' but reads better
as 'completed one's scriptural education,' as here:

[quote, Sn.v.463]
____
One who has submitted to inward taming, completed his scriptural education,

no freedom from suffering.

_Gamanena na pattabbo lokassanto kudācanaṃ +

Therefore, truly, one who knows the world [of phenomena] [according to
reality], one of great wisdom, one who has reached the end of the world [of
phenomena], fulfiller of the religious life, knowing the end of the world [of
phenomena] [according to reality], inwardly at peace, longs not for this world

=== Anvāssavati; Anussavati

==== Renderings

- _anvāssavati_: to pursue

- _anussavati_: to pursue

==== Introduction

===== Etymology

- _Anvāssavati_ is _anu+ā+savati_
- _Anussavati_ is _anu+savati_

===== Alternative spellings

Their alternative spellings are

- _anvāsavati_
- _anusavati_

===== Equivalence in practice

The two words are used in similar ways, which suggests their equivalence, for
example:

[quote, S.4.188]
____
spiritually unwholesome factors do not pursue him

_akusalā dhammā nānussavanti._
____

[quote, M.3.113]
____
spiritually unwholesome factors will pursue him

_akusalā dhammā anvāssavissantī ti._
____

===== To pursue: to continue to afflict

Because _savati_ means 'to flow,' it is tempting to render both words in terms
of 'flow,' as translators often do, and so does DOP ('flows after, flows upon,
flows continually over'). But the PED suggests _anvāssavati_ means not just
'stream into' but also 'attack, befall.' We prefer 'pursue' because it means
'to continue to afflict' (Webster's). One simile in particular shows the
incongruity of 'flow,' where flies 'attack and pursue' someone smelling like a
rotten corpse. See illustrations below.

example, both BJT and VRI versions read:

2. Bhante, it would be good if the Blessed One would explain the teaching to me
in brief, so that, having heard the teaching from the Blessed One, I might
abide alone, withdrawn [from human fellowship, sensuous pleasures, and
spiritually unwholesome factors], diligently, vigorously, and resolutely
applied [to the practice].

=== Abhijānāti; Parijānāti

==== Renderings

- _abhijānāti_: to recall

- _abhijānāti_: to fully understand

- _nabhijānāti_: to not understand

- _nabhijānāti_: to not know

- _abhiññā_: full understanding

- _abhiññā_: transcendent insight

- _abhiññā_: supernormal attainment

- _parijānāti_: to profoundly understand

- _pariññā_: profound understanding

==== Introduction

===== Distinguished levels of understanding

_Abhijānāti_ is often paired with _parijānāti_ in contexts which, for both
words, imply distinguished levels of understanding by arahants and other noble
disciples. The words are here called 'full understanding' and 'profound
understanding.'

===== Parijānāti more sublime

Profound understanding is more sublime than full understanding because it is
usually restricted to arahants. Rarely it is applied to non-returners (e.g.
_pañcakāmaguṇike rāge pariññate natthi taṃ saṃyojanaṃ yena
saṃyojanena saṃyutto ariyasāvako puna imaṃ lokaṃ āgaccheyya_, S.2.99).

===== Pariññā and nibbāna

The noun of _parijānāti_ is _pariññā,_ which shares the definition of
_nibbāna_ (_rāgakkhayo dosakkhayo mohakkhayo ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave
pariññā ti_ S.3.26; _rāgakkhayo dosakkhayo mohakkhayo idaṃ vuccati
nibbānan ti_ S.4.251).

===== Nābhijānāti: not understand, not recall

When _abhijānāti_ occurs in the negative it means either:

1. to not know

2. to not understand

3. to not recall

[quote, Sn.v.1117]
____
This world, the world hereafter, the brahmā world, and the deva world. I do
not know the celebrated Gotama's view of these.

____

====
anabhijānaṃ

recall
====

[quote, Vin.3.91]
____
If a bhikkhu, though not recalling it, should claim with reference to himself a
superhuman attainment of knowledge and vision that is worthy of the Noble Ones,
saying "Thus I know; thus I see;" then, whether or not he is later interrogated
about it, fallen and seeking purification, he says "Friends, though not
knowing, I said 'I know'; though not seeing, I said 'I see.' I boasted vainly
and falsely"; unless it was from over-estimation, he is pārājika, no longer
in communion.

_yo pana bhikkhu anabhijānaṃ uttarimanussadhammaṃ attūpanāyikaṃ
alamariyañāṇadassanaṃ samudācareyya Iti jānāmi iti passāmī ti tato
aparena samayena samanuggāhiyamāno vā asamanuggāhiyamāno vā āpanno
visuddhāpekkho evaṃ vadeyya ajānam evaṃ āvuso avacaṃ jānāmi;
apassaṃ passāmi. Tucchaṃ musā vilapin ti. Aññatra adhimānā ayampi
pārājiko hoti asaṃvāso._
____

Comment:

Rendering _anabhijānaṃ_ as 'recall' is supported by a perspective on the
Word Commentary's definition of 'interrogated' (_samanuggāhiyamāno_), as
follows:

____
'Interrogated means: when a matter (i.e. a claim to have attained a superhuman
attainment) is acknowledged, he is asked: What was attained by you? How was it
attained? When was it attained? Where was it attained? Which spiritual
defilements have you abandoned? Which states have you gained?

_Samanuggāhīyamāno ti yaṃ vatthu paṭiññātaṃ hoti tasmiṃ
vatthusmiṃ samanuggāhīyamāno kinte adhigataṃ kinti te adhigataṃ kadā
te adhigataṃ kattha te adhigataṃ katame te kilesā pahīnā katamesaṃ
tvaṃ dhammānaṃ lābhī ti._
____

The correct answer to these questions would logically be 'I do not recall
attaining any superhuman attainment' rather than 'I do not know any superhuman
attainment.' Nonetheless, _anabhijānaṃ_ in this rule is usually rendered
'not knowing.' This produces stilted results:

- Horner: Whatever monk should boast with reference to himself of a state of
further-men, sufficient ariyan knowledge and insight, though not knowing it
fully, and saying: 'This I know, this I see.'.. (BD.1.159).

- Norman: Whatever bhikkhu should, while not knowing [for certain], boast a
superhuman state, knowledge and insight deserving the name 'noble,' as being
present in himself, [saying] 'I know thus, I see thus.'.. (The Pātimokkha,
PTS, 2001).

=== Abhijjhā

==== Renderings

- _abhijjhā_: greed

- _abhijjhālu_: greedy

==== Introduction

===== Abhijjhā: greed not covetousness

_Abhijjhā_ has long been called 'covetousness,' which means the desire for
other's possessions, but it more likely means 'greed,' because:

1. PED says it is 'almost identical in meaning with _lobha.'_

2. The _Sāḷha Sutta_ (A.1.194) says _lobho_ and _abhijjhā_ are synonyms
(_taṃ kiṃ maññatha sāḷhā atthi lobho ti? Evaṃ bhante. Abhijjhā ti
kho ahaṃ sāḷhā etamatthaṃ vadāmi_ (A.1.194).

3. In the scriptures _abhijjhā_ stands for the first of the five hindrances,
where it is linked to sensuous pleasure (_abhijjhālū kāmesu_ It.91), and is
listed with the other four hindrances (_vyāpannacittā thīnamiddha uddhatā
vicikicchī_ M.1.17-18). In this last reference it is linked to _rāga_
(_abhijjhālū kāmesu tibbasārāgā_ M.1.17-18).

===== Abhijjhā: broad meaning more likely

Objection to rendering _abhijjhā_ as greed may be raised on the grounds that
_abhijjhā_ is explained in terms of covetousness:

[quote, M.3.49]
____
'In this regard, some person is greedy. He covets others' property and
possessions: "Oh, may what belongs to another be mine!"'

_idha bhante ekacco abhijjhālu hoti yaṃ taṃ parassa
paravittūpakaraṇaṃ taṃ abhijjhātā hoti aho vata yaṃ parassa taṃ
mamassā ti._
____

But this is in illustration of the two types of mental conduct, good and bad,
where _abhijjhālū_ and _vyāpannacitto_ are bad, and _anabhijjhālū_ and
_avyāpannacitto_ are good. In this situation, it is likely the two words stand
for two broad categories (greed and hatred), not one narrow category and one
broad category (covetousness and hatred). The same is true of
_abhijjhādomanassā,_ where it is more likely that _abhijjhā_ has a broad
meaning, not a narrow meaning. For example:

1. While I am pacing back and forth thus, neither greed nor dejection nor
unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors will pursue me.
+
****
_nābhijjhādomanassā pāpakā akusalā dhammā anvāssavissantī ti_
(M.3.113).
****

2. A bhikkhu abides contemplating the nature of the body, vigorously, fully
consciously, and mindfully, having eliminated greed and dejection in regard to
the world [of phenomena].
+
****
_vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ_ (S.5.182).
****

===== Abhijjhā: not in relation to others' possessions

_Abhijjhā_ is not always linked to others' possessions:

[quote, Th.v.794-5]
____
In seeing a visible object with mindfulness muddled, focusing on the agreeable
aspect, one experiences it with a mind of attachment and persists in cleaving
to it. Many sense impressions arising from the visible object blossom [within
oneself], greed and vexation as well, by which one's mind becomes disturbed.

===== On longing for the future

One 'takes delight' in the present, or 'longs for' the future. 'Longing for'
the future means directing the mind with desire (_cittaṃ paṇidahati_), as
follows:

How does one long for the future?

_Kathañcāvuso anāgataṃ paṭikaṅkhati:_

(...) One directs one's mind to acquire what has not yet been acquired, thinking,
'May the visual sense and visible objects be thus in the future.' In directing
one's mind thus, one longs for it. In doing so one longs for the future.

===== The amatadhātu of non-arahants: the immortal phenomenon

Confusingly, there is another _amatadhātu_ that is realised by non-arahants, a
state which is also called _nibbāna._ We call this 'the immortal phenomenon.'
We will show that it is equivalent to inward collectedness that is focused upon
the unabiding [phenomena] (_animitto cetosamādhi_). This latter state likewise
does not necessarily mean arahantship, as Venerable MahāMoggallāna
discovered: while he abided therein, his mind pursued phantasms.

===== Animitto cetosamādhi: Venerable MahāMoggallāna's mind pursued phantasms

MahāMoggallāna said:

[quote, S.4.263-269]
____
Here, friends, while I was alone in solitary retreat, a reflection arose in my
mind thus: 'It is said, "inward collectedness that is focused upon the
unabiding [phenomena]; inward collectedness that is focused upon the unabiding
[phenomena]." What now is the inward collectedness that is focused upon the
unabiding [phenomena]?'

_Animitto cetosamādhi animitto cetosamādhīti vuccati katamo nu kho animitto
cetosamādhī ti_

(...) Then, friends, it occurred to me:

_Tassa mayhaṃ āvuso etadahosi_

(...) In this regard a bhikkhu, by not focusing upon any abiding phenomenon,

_Idha bhikkhu sabbanimittānaṃ amanasikārā_

(...) enters and abides in the inward collectedness that is focused upon the
unabiding [phenomena].

_animittaṃ cetosamādhiṃ upasampajja viharati_

(...) This is called the inward collectedness that is focused upon the unabiding
[phenomena].

_ayaṃ vuccati animitto cetosamādhī ti._

(...) Then, friends, by not focusing upon any abiding phenomenon,

_So khvāhaṃ āvuso sabbanimittānaṃ amanasikārā_

(...) I entered and dwelt in inward collectedness that is focused upon the
unabiding [phenomena].

_animittaṃ cetosamādhiṃ upasampajja viharāmi_

(...) While I abided therein my mind pursued phantasms.

_tassa mayhaṃ āvuso iminā vihārena viharato nimittānusārī viññānam
hoti._

===== Focusing one's mind on the immortal phenomenon

[quote, M.1.435]
____
In the _Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta_ the Buddha discusses the path and practice
to abandon the five ties to individual existence in the low plane of existence
(i.e. the path to non-returnership).

_Katamo cānanda maggo katamā paṭipadā pañcannaṃ orambhāgiyānaṃ
saṃyojanānaṃ pahānāya?_
____

He explains that in this path and practice a bhikkhu:

1. enters jhāna, then

2. contemplates the five aggregates as an illness, a carbuncle, a [piercing]
arrow, suffering etc, then
+
_te dhamme aniccato dukkhato rogato gaṇḍato sallato aghato ābādhato
parato palokato suññato anattato samanupassati_

3. averts his mind from those states, then
+
_So tehi dhammehi cittaṃ paṭivāpeti_

4. focuses his mind on the immortal phenomenon:
+
_so tehi dhammehi cittaṃ paṭivāpetvā amatāya dhātuyā cittaṃ upasaṃharati_

5. Focusing on the immortal phenomenon is followed in the sutta by the
following reflection:
+
[quote, M.1.435]
____
This is peaceful, this is sublime, namely: the quelling of all originated
phenomena, the relinquishment of the whole phenomenon of attachment, the
destruction of craving, the passing away [of originated phenomena], the ending
[of originated phenomena], the Untroubled.

_etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ yadidaṃ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho
sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhākkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānan ti._
____

6. The sutta then says: 'Established therein, he attains the destruction of
perceptually obscuring states.
+
_So tattha ṭhito āsavānaṃ khayaṃ pāpuṇāti_
+
The destruction of perceptually obscuring states means the attainment of
arahantship. Therefore arahantship occurs after having focused the mind on the
immortal phenomenon, and even after the reflection 'this is _nibbāna_.' In
this case, the immortal phenomenon and _nibbāna_ precede arahantship.

7. The sutta confirms this because it says that those who have the _etaṃ
santaṃ_ reflection may not attain arahantship until the following life,
because it says:
+
[quote, M.1.435]
____
'If the bhikkhu does not thereby attain the destruction of perceptually
obscuring states, then he arises spontaneously [in the higher planes of
existence], there to attain nibbāna-without-residue, never to return from
those worlds.'

_no ce āsavānaṃ khayaṃ pāpuṇāti... opapātiko hoti tattha
parinibbāyī anāvattidhammo tasmā lokā._
____

In other words, the immortal phenomenon that one focuses one's mind on is
linked to either arahantship or non-returnership.

===== The immortal phenomenon means animittadhātu

That the immortal phenomenon means _animittadhātu_ (the unabiding phenomenon)
can be demonstrated in seven steps:

1. The experience of focusing on the _amatadhātu_ is described in the _etaṃ
santaṃ_ reflection, as noted above (M.1.435-7).

2. The _etaṃ santaṃ_ reflection is equivalent to the winning of inward
collectedness such that though one does not contemplate the visual sense or
visible object... yet one still contemplates.
+
****
_Idhānanda bhikkhu evaṃ manasikaroti etaṃ santaṃ... nibbānan ti evaṃ
kho ānanda siyā bhikkhuno tathārūpo samādhipaṭilābho yathā na
cakkhuṃ manasikareyya na rūpaṃ manasikareyya... yampidaṃ diṭṭhaṃ
sutaṃ mutaṃ viññātaṃ pattaṃ pariyesitaṃ anuvicaritaṃ manasā
tampi na manasikareyya manasi ca pana kareyyā ti_ (A.5.321).
****

3. These objects that one does not contemplate are called 'all _nimittāni'_
(_sabbanimittāni_) in this passage:
+
[quote, S.4.50]
____
He perceives all phenomena (_sabbanimittāni_) differently. He sees the visual
sense differently, he sees visible objects differently... .

_sabbanimittāni aññato passati cakkhuṃ aññato passati rūpe aññato
passati... mano aññato passati dhamme aññato passati manoviññāṇaṃ
aññato passati manosamphassaṃ aññato passati yampidaṃ mano
samphassapaccayā uppajjati sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā
tampi aññato passati._
____

4. Thus focusing on the _amatadhātu_ is equivalent to not contemplating all
_nimittāni_ (_sabbanimittāni na manasikareyya_) yet still contemplating
(_manasi ca pana kareyyā ti_).

5. 'Still contemplating' implies contemplating what is _animitta._

6. Attaining the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] by focusing
upon the unabiding [phenomenon] (_animittāya cetovimuttiyā samāpattiyā_)
involves two similar steps:
+
[quote, M.1.297]
____
ignoring all _nimittāni_

_sabbanimittānañca amanasikāro_

focusing upon the _animitta_ phenomenon

_animittāya ca dhātuyā manasikāro._
____

7. Therefore these phrases are equivalent:
+
[quote, M.1.435]
____
he focuses his mind on the _amatadhātu_

_amatāya dhātuyā cittaṃ upasaṃharati_
____
+
[quote, M.1.297]
____
focusing upon the _animittadhātu_

_animittāya ca dhātuyā manasikāro._
____

That focusing on _animittadhātu_ means perceiving the passing away and ending
[of originated phenomena] (_virāgasaññā_ and _nirodhasaññā_) is
discussed sv _Nimitta_. Presumably the _amatadhātu_ is named as such (and even
called _nibbāna_ in the _etaṃ santaṃ_ reflection) because of the immortal
quality of these two perceptions.

[quote, "M.1.435-7, A.4.421"]
____
A bhikkhu enters and abides in first jhāna, which is accompanied by thinking
and pondering, and rapture and physical pleasure born of seclusion [from
sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors].

_savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ
upasampajja viharati._

He regards whatever phenomena there that are connected with the five
aggregates, as unlasting, as existentially void, as an illness, as a carbuncle,
as a [piercing] arrow, as suffering, as an affliction, as alien, as destined to
decay, as void [of personal qualities], as void of personal qualities.

_So yadeva tattha hoti rūpagataṃ vedanāgataṃ saññāgataṃ
saṅkhāragataṃ viññāṇagataṃ te dhamme aniccato dukkhato rogato
gaṇḍato sallato aghato ābādhato parato palokato suññato anattato
samanupassati._

He averts his mind from those states.

_So tehi dhammehi cittaṃ paṭivāpeti_

and focuses his mind on the immortal phenomenon:

_so tehi dhammehi cittaṃ paṭivāpetvā amatāya dhātuyā cittaṃ
upasaṃharati_

This is peaceful, this is sublime, namely: the quelling of all originated
phenomena, the relinquishment of the whole phenomenon of attachment, the
destruction of craving, the passing away [of originated phenomena], the ending
[of originated phenomena], the Untroubled.

_etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ yadidaṃ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho
sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhākkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānan ti._

Established therein, he attains the destruction of perceptually obscuring
states.

_So tattha ṭhito āsavānaṃ khayaṃ pāpuṇāti_

If he does not attain the destruction of perceptually obscuring states,
then because of that righteous attachment, righteous spiritually fettering
delight, with the destruction of the five ties to individual existence in the
low plane of existence, he arises spontaneously [in the higher planes of
existence], there to attain nibbāna-without-residue, never to return from
those worlds.

=== Avijjā

==== Renderings

- _avijjā_: uninsightfulness into reality

- _avijjāgata_: void of insight into reality

- _avijjāgato hoti_: to lack insight into reality

- _vijjā_: insightfulness into reality

- _vijjā_: insightfulness

- _vijjāgata_: having insight into reality

- _vijjāgato hoti_: to be possessed of insight into reality

==== Introduction

===== Ignorance: extraordinary consensus

_Avijjā_ has been called 'ignorance' at least since 1875 when Childers'
dictionary appeared. Even today this word is universally accepted. The
consensus is extraordinary.

===== What is missing: insight

'Ignorance' means lack of knowledge or education that is abandoned through
knowledge and education. But _avijjā_ is abandoned through transcendent
insight (_abhiññā pahātabbā_ A.2.247). What is missing in _avijjā_ is not
knowledge but insight.

===== Channa's stumbling block: lack of insight

The difference between knowledge and insight is illustrated in the case of
Venerable Channa who knew the teaching but did not see the nature of reality
(_dhammaṃ passato hoti_). Although he understood the theory of _anicca_, he
lacked insight. So he asked Venerable Ānanda to explain the teaching in such a
way that he might see the nature of reality (_dhammaṃ passeyyan ti_)
(S.3.133). Channa's stumbling block was not knowledge, so he was not 'ignorant'.

===== Overcoming avijjā: a matter of insight

With enlightenment, when _avijjā_ is dispelled and _vijjā_ arises (_avijjā
vihatā vijjā uppannā_) 'darkness is banished, and light arises' (_tamo
vihato āloko uppanno_) (M.1.248). One knows and sees (_evaṃ jānato evaṃ
passato_) the four noble truths as clearly as if one were looking at fish in a
crystal clear pond (D.1.84). Overcoming _avijjā_ is therefore a matter of
insight not knowledge. Other quotations below make the same point.

This means:

[quote, S.2.181-2]
____
A first point is not to be discerned of beings with the hindrance of
uninsightfulness into reality, and with the tie to individual existence of
craving, roaming and wandering the round of birth and death

_Pubbā koṭi na paññāyati avijjānīvaraṇānaṃ sattānaṃ
taṇhāsaṃyojanānaṃ sandhāvataṃ saṃsarataṃ._
____

We render the terms as:

- _avijjā_: uninsightfulness into reality
- _taṇhā_: craving
- _saṃyojanānaṃ_: tie to individual existence

But translators commonly render _nīvaraṇānaṃ_ and _saṃyojanānaṃ_ as
past participles: 'hindered' and 'fettered':

- 'hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving' (Bodhi, S.2.181).

- 'hindered by ignorance, fettered by craving' (Horner, M.1.294).

But the suttas show that the relevant past participles are _nivutā_ and
_saṃyuttā_.

===== Avijjanīvaraṇa Sutta: nivutā

The past participle given in the _Avijjanīvaraṇa Sutta_ for _nīvaraṇaṃ_
is _nivutā_ ('obstructed by'):

[quote, It.9]
____
Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single hindrance obstructed by which beings
would roam and wander the round of birth and death for such a long time as the
hindrance of uninsightfulness into reality. Obstructed by the hindrance of
uninsightfulness into reality, beings roam and wander the round of birth and
death for a long time.

_Nāhaṃ bhikkhave aññaṃ ekanīvaraṇampi samanupassāmi yena
nīvaraṇena nivutā pajā dīgharattaṃ sandhāvanti saṃsaranti
yathayidaṃ bhikkhave avijjānīvaraṇaṃ. Avijjānīvaraṇena hi bhikkhave
nivutā pajā dīgharattaṃ sandhāvanti saṃsarantī ti._
____

The connection between _avijjā_ and _nivuto_ is confirmed in the _Vaṅgīsa
Sutta_:

[quote, Sn.v.1033]
____
The world [of beings] is obstructed by uninsightfulness into reality

_Avijjāya nivuto loko._
____

===== Taṇhāsaṃyojana Suttas: saṃyuttā

The past participle given in the _Taṇhāsaṃyojana Sutta_ for
_saṃyojanānaṃ_ is _saṃyuttā_ ('tethered by').

[quote, It.9]
____
Bhikkhus, I do not see any other single tie to individual existence, tethered
by which beings would roam and wander the round of birth and death for such a
long time as the tie of craving. Tethered [to individual existence] by the tie
of craving, beings roam and wander the round of birth and death for a long time.

_Nāhaṃ bhikkhave aññaṃ ekasaṃyojanampi samanupassāmi yena
saṃyojanena saṃyuttā sattā dīgharattaṃ sandhāvanti saṃsaranti
yathayidaṃ bhikkhave taṇhāsaṃyojanaṃ. Taṇhāsaṃyojanena hi
bhikkhave saṃyuttā sattā dīgharattaṃ sandhāvanti saṃsarantī ti._
____

===== Nivutā: meaning

_Nivuta_ is the past participle of _nivarati_ ('surrounded, hemmed in,
obstructed, enveloped,' PED). We call it 'obstructed.' Some call it 'shrouded
in' or 'enveloped in,' but it is associated in the suttas with the instrumental
case, not the locative case:

[quote, Sn.v.1032]
____
By what is the world [of beings] obstructed?

_Kena ssu nivuto loko._
____

===== Saṃyuttā: meaning

Our research shows that _saṃyuttā_ means 'tethered [to individual
existence].' See sv _Saṃyutta_. In the passage from the _Taṇhāsaṃyojana
Sutta_ quoted above, the structure of the sentence rendered the parenthesis
unnecessary.

===== Applying the past participles

If these missing past participles are inserted, it produces the following
result, full of redundancy:

[quote, S.2.181-2]
____
A first point is not to be discerned of beings [obstructed by] the hindrance of
uninsightfulness into reality, and [tethered to individual existence] by the
tie to individual existence of craving, roaming and wandering the round of
birth and death.

_pubbā koṭi na paññāyati avijjānīvaraṇānaṃ sattānaṃ
taṇhāsaṃyojanānaṃ sandhāvataṃ saṃsarataṃ._
____

===== Removing the redundancy

Without redundancy, the phrase becomes:

[quote, S.2.181-2]
____
A first point is not to be discerned of beings [obstructed by] uninsightfulness
into reality, and [tethered to individual existence] by craving, roaming and
wandering the round of birth and death.

_pubbā koṭi na paññāyati avijjānīvaraṇānaṃ sattānaṃ
taṇhāsaṃyojanānaṃ sandhāvataṃ saṃsarataṃ._
____

Ironically, then, we have simply replaced _nīvaraṇānaṃ_ and
_saṃyojanānaṃ_ with _nivutā_ and _saṃyuttā_, and apart from adding
brackets, have followed Bodhi and Horner exactly:

- 'hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving' (Bodhi, S.2.181).

- 'hindered by ignorance, fettered by craving' (Horner, M.1.294).

=== Aveccappasāda

==== Renderings

- _aveccappasāda_: unshakeable faith

- _aveccappasannā_: having unshakeable faith

- _buddhe aveccappasāda_: unshakeable faith in the [perfection of the]
Buddha's [transcendent insight]

- _dhamme aveccappasāda_: unshakeable faith in the [significance of the]
teaching

- _saṅghe aveccappasāda_: unshakeable faith in the [praiseworthiness of the]
community of disciples' [application to the practice]

==== Introduction

===== Etymology: avecca

The etymology and meaning of _avecca_ is at last clear, because whereas the PED
had said 'the form is not sufficiently clear semantically,' the DOP now
recognises it as an absolutive of _aveti_, to know. Therefore Th.v.497 can be
translated accordingly:

[quote, Th.v.497]
____
One is neither a thief nor a sage by the word of another. But as one knows
oneself, the devas likewise know one too.

_Na pare vacanā coro na pare vacanā muni +
Attā ca naṃ yathāveti devā pi naṃ tathā vidū._
____

Notice that _veti_ in pāda c corresponds to _vidū_ in pāda d, from
_vindati_, to know.

===== Avecca: meaning

DOP says _avecca_ means 'having penetrated' or 'understanding.' Norman says
'having understood' or 'understanding':

1. 'He who having understood the noble truths sees them [clearly]'
+
****
_Yo ariyasaccāni avecca passati_ (Norman, Sn.v.229).
****

2. 'Understanding all knowledge, you have revealed the doctrine, having
sympathy for beings.'
+
****
_Sabbaṃ tuvaṃ ñāṇamavecca dhammaṃ pakāsesi satte anukampamāno_
(Norman, Sn.v.378).
****

DOP's 'having penetrated' makes better sense, and we have shown sv _Passati_
that when it lacks an object, _passati_ means 'see [the nature of reality].'
Thus we translate the two verses as:

1. He who, having penetrated the [four] noble truths, sees [the nature of
reality] (Sn.v.229).

2. Having penetrated all knowledge, you have explained the teaching (Sn.v.378).

Thus, so far, if _pasāda_ means 'faith,' _aveccappasāda_ means 'faith through
having penetrated.'

===== Avecca and unshakability

_Avecca_ is linked in the scriptures to unshakability, for example in this
verse:

[quote, Sn.v.229]
____
Like a locking-post firmly embedded in the ground that is unshakeable by the
winds of the four quarters, I declare, is the [quality of a] spiritually
outstanding person, who, having penetrated the [four] noble truths, sees [the
nature of reality].

_Yathindakhīlo paṭhaviṃ sito siyā catubbhi vātehi asampakampiyo +
Tathūpamaṃ sappurisaṃ vadāmi yo ariyasaccāni avecca passati._
____

If _avecca_ implies unshakability, then _aveccappasāda_ seems to mean faith
that is unshakeable on account of having penetrated profound truths.

===== Faith is stabilised by knowledge: Sekha Sutta

The theme of stabilising faith through knowledge is confirmed in the _Sekha
Sutta_, which says that noble knowledge [of things according to reality]
(_ariyañāṇaṃ_) stabilises four of the faculties, including the faculty of
faith (_saddhindriya_):

[quote, S.5.228-9]
____
When noble knowledge [of things according to reality] has arisen in the noble
disciple, then there is stability and steadiness in four faculties. Which four?
The faculties of faith [in the perfection of the Perfect One's transcendent
insight], energetic application [to the practice], mindfulness, and inward
collectedness.

_yato ca kho bhikkhave ariyasāvakassa ariyañāṇaṃ uppannaṃ hoti atha
catunnaṃ indriyānaṃ saṇṭhiti hoti atha catunnaṃ indriyānaṃ
avaṭṭhiti hoti. Katamesaṃ catunnaṃ saddhindriyassa viriyindriyassa
satindriyassa samādhindriyassa._
____

===== Faith is stabilised by knowledge: Vīmaṃsaka Sutta

Likewise the _Vīmaṃsaka Sutta_. Here a disciple explains how his unshakeable
faith arose from transcendent insight into the teaching:

[quote, M.1.320]
____
As the Blessed One explained the teaching to me with its increasingly higher
and more sublime levels, concerning what is inwardly dark and bright with their
correlative combinations, thus through transcendent insight into a certain one
of those teachings, I came to a conclusion about the teachings. I gained faith
in the Teacher thus: "The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened. The teaching is
well explained by the Blessed One. The community of disciples is applied to an
excellent practice."

_Yathā yathā me āvuso bhagavā dhammaṃ deseti uttaruttariṃ
paṇītapaṇītaṃ kaṇhasukkasappaṭibhāgaṃ tathā tathāhaṃ
tasmiṃ dhamme abhiññāya idhekaccaṃ dhammaṃ dhammesu
niṭṭhamagamaṃ satthari pasīdiṃ sammā sambuddho bhagavā svākkhāto
bhagavatā dhammo supaṭipanno saṅgho ti._

(...) Bhikkhus, when one's faith in the [perfection of the] Perfect One's
[transcendent insight] is settled, rooted, and established, and described in
these terms, words, and phrases, then one's faith is said to be supported by
reasons, rooted in vision [of things according to reality], and firm. It is not
shakeable by any ascetic, Brahmanist, deva, māra, or brahmā, or by anyone in
the world.

_Yassa kassa ci bhikkhave imehi ākārehi imehi padehi imehi vyañjanehi
tathāgate saddhā niviṭṭhā hoti mūlajātā patiṭṭhitā ayaṃ
vuccatī bhikkhave ākāravatī saddhā dassanamūlikā daḷhā asaṃhāriyā
samaṇena vā brāhmaṇena vā devena vā mārena vā brahmunā vā kenaci
vā lokasmiṃ._
____

===== Aveccappasāda: unshakeable faith

In conclusion, _aveccappasāda_ implies a faith that is 'supported by reasons,
rooted in vision [of things according to reality], and firm. It is not
shakeable by any ascetic, Brahmanist, deva, māra, or brahmā.' We call it
'unshakeable faith.'

===== Buddhe aveccappasāda

A noble disciple who has unshakeable faith in the Buddha (_buddhe
aveccappasādena samannāgato hoti_) has come to the conclusion that:

[quote, S.5.390]
____
He is indeed the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One,
perfect in insightfulness into reality and in conduct, the Sublime One, one who
knows the world [of phenomena] [according to reality], the unexcelled trainer
of men to be tamed, the teacher of devas and men, the Enlightened One, the
Blessed One.

_iti pi so bhagavā arahaṃ sammā sambuddho vijjācaraṇasampanno sugato
lokavidu anuttaro purisadammasārathī satthā devamanussānaṃ buddho
bhagavā ti._
____

According to this, the noble disciple's faith is not in the person of the
Buddha, but in the perfection of his transcendent insight. This is in
accordance with the definition of _saddhindriyaṃ_ which is linked to
_tathāgatassa bodhiṃ_:

[quote, S.5.196]
____
And what is the faculty of faith? In this regard, the noble disciple has faith.
He has faith in the [perfection of the] Perfect One's transcendent insight: 'He
is indeed the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, perfect
in insightfulness into reality and in conduct, the Sublime One, one who knows
the world [of phenomena] [according to reality], the unexcelled trainer of men
to be tamed, the teacher of devas and men, the Enlightened One, the Blessed
One.'

_Katamañca bhikkhave saddhindriyaṃ idha bhikkhave ariyasāvako saddho hoti
saddahati tathāgatassa bodhiṃ iti pi so bhagavā arahaṃ sammāsambuddho
vijjācaraṇasampanno sugato lokavidū anuttaro purisadammasārathī satthā
devamanussānaṃ buddho bhagavā ti. Idaṃ vuccati bhikkhave saddhindriyaṃ._
____

Therefore 'unshakeable faith in the Buddha' means 'unshakeable faith in the
[perfection of the] Buddha's [transcendent insight].'

In this Glossary, therefore, _bodhiṃ_ and _abhiññā_ are treated as
synonyms:

[quote, A.3.9]
____
I claim to have reached the consummation and perfection of transcendent insight
into profound truths not heard before

_pubbāhaṃ bhikkhave ananussutesu dhammesu abhiññāvosānapāramippatto
paṭijānāmi._
____

[quote, A.1.276]
____
Bhikkhus, I explain the teaching with transcendent insight, not without
transcendent insight.

_abhiññāyā'haṃ bhikkhave dhammaṃ desemi no anabhiññāya._
____

===== Dhamme aveccappasāda

A noble disciple who has unshakeable faith in the teaching (_dhamme
aveccappasādena samannāgato hoti_) has come to the conclusion that:

[quote, S.5.390]
____
The teaching is well explained by the Blessed One, fathomable in this lifetime,
realisable in the here and now, intriguing, personally applicable, to be
realised by the wise for themselves._

_svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo sandiṭṭhiko akāliko ehipassiko opanayiko
paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhī ti._
____

In the light of these qualities, the teaching's excellence and effectiveness,
'unshakeable faith in the Dhamma' means 'unshakeable faith in the [significance
of the] teaching.'

===== Saṅghe aveccappasāda

A noble disciple who has unshakeable faith in the community of disciples
(_saṅghe aveccappasādena samannāgato hoti_) has come to the conclusion that:

[quote, S.5.390]
____
The community of the Blessed One's disciples is applied to an excellent
practice, is applied to the correct practice, is applied to the noble practice,
is applied to a proper practice; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight
types of individuals. This community of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy
of offerings, hospitality, gifts, and honouring with joined palms. They are the
unsurpassed field of merit for the world._

_supaṭipanno bhagavato sāvakasaṅgho ujupaṭipanno bhagato sāvakasaṅgho
ñāyapaṭipanno bhagavato sāvakasaṅgho sāmīcipaṭipanno bhagavato
sāvakasaṅgho yadidaṃ cattāri purisayugāni aṭṭhapurisapuggalā
esabhagavato sāvakasaṅgho āhuneyyo pāhuneyyo dakkhiṇeyyo
añjalikaraṇīyo anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassāti._
____

'Unshakeable faith in the community of disciples' is therefore not faith in the
members of the community themselves, but rather, in the praiseworthiness of
their application to the practice.

===== Increasing levels of unshakeability

Although unshakeable faith is associated with stream-entry, the
_Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta_ says one cannot conclude that the Blessed One is
perfectly enlightened until arahantship:

[quote, M.1.184]
____
And it is not until this point that a noble disciple can come to the
conclusion: 'The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened; the teaching is well
explained by the Blessed One; the community of the Blessed One's disciples is
applied to an excellent practice.'"

_Ettāvatā kho brāhmaṇa ariyasāvako niṭṭhaṃ gato hoti
sammāsambuddho bhagavā svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo supaṭipanno bhagavato
sāvakasaṅgho ti._
____

At levels lesser than arahantship, the faculties, including the faculty of
faith, are correspondingly weaker:

[quote, S.5.200]
____
One who has completed and fulfilled these five spiritual faculties is an
arahant. If they are weaker than that, one is a non-returner; if still weaker,
a once-returner; if still weaker, a stream-enterer.

_Imesaṃ kho bhikkhave pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ samattā paripūrattā
arahaṃ hoti. Tato mudutarehi anāgāmī hoti. Tato mudutarehi sakadāgāmī
hoti. Tato mudutarehi sotāpanno hoti._

=== Asmi

==== Renderings

- _asmi_ (verb): I am

- _asmi_ (noun): the notion "I am"

- _asmi_ (noun): "[in reality] what I am"

- _asmi_ (adjective): egocentric

- _asmī ti māna_: self-centredness (equivalent to _māna_)

- _asmimāna_: self-centredness (equivalent to _māna_)

- _asmī ti anusayo_: the proclivity to self-centredness

==== Introduction

===== Potential meanings of asmi

_Asmi_ means 'I am' (verb), but the _Khemaka Sutta_ (S.3.126-132) shows four
other renderings may occasionally be justified.

1. the notion "I am" (noun)

2. "[in reality] what I am" (noun)

3. egocentric (adjective)

4. redundancy in the phrase _asmī ti māno_ (='self-centredness'), because
_māno_ is equivalent to _asmī ti māno_. This is covered sv _māno_.

===== Asmi in the Khemaka Sutta: 'the notion "I am"

In the _Khemaka Sutta_, Venerable Khemaka said the notion "I am" was still to
be found in him in relation to the five grasped aggregates
(_pañcasupādānakkhandhesu asmī ti adhigataṃ_). He said this was a vague
sense, like perfume around a lotus, not located in any particular part of the
flower. Here, therefore, _asmī ti_ is rendered 'the notion "I am."'

===== Asmi in the Khemaka Sutta: "[in reality] what I am"

Venerable Khemaka said that although the notion "I am" was still found in him,
nonetheless he did not regard any particular one of aggregates as "[in reality]
what I am" (_ayamahamasmī ti ca na samanupassāmī ti_). Here, therefore,
_asmī ti_ is "[in reality] what I am."

===== Asmi in the Khemaka Sutta: egocentric

____
The bhikkhus asked him: 'Friend Khemaka, when you mention this notion "I am"
(_asmī ti vadesi_) what do you say is "[in reality] what I am"? (_kimetaṃ
asmī ti vadesi?_). Do you say that the five aggregates are "[in reality] what
I am," or do you say that "[in reality] what I am" is separate from the five
aggregates?

_Rūpaṃ asmī ti vadesi? Aññatra rūpā asmī ti vadesi?... Viññāṇaṃ
asmī ti vadesi? Aññatra viññāṇā asmī ti vadesi?_
____

Venerable Khemaka replied: 'Friends, I do not say the five aggregates are "[in
reality] what I am," nor do I say that "[in reality] what I am" is separate
from the five aggregates.' Then he explained:

'Friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five ties to
individual existence in the low plane of existence (_pañcorambhāgiyāni
saṃyojanāni_) still, in regard to the five grasped aggregates
(_pañcasupādānakkhandhesu_) there remains within him

____
a residual self-centredness _

_anusahagato asmī ti māno_

a residual egocentric desire

_asmī ti chando_

a residual proclivity to self-centredness that have not yet been abolished

_asmī ti anusayo asamūhato._

If he abides contemplating the [co-conditional] arising and disappearance of
the five grasped aggregates, these three residual phenomena are abolished.

_pañcasupādānakkhandhesu udayabbayānupassino viharato._
____

Venerable Khemaka compared these three residual phenomena to the aroma of a
cloth cleaned with cowdung, which even though clean, would retain an unpleasant
aroma. If placed in a sweet-scented casket, the aroma would dissipate.
Likewise, with proper practice, the dung-like aroma of self-centredness will
fade away.

Thus, in the phrase _asmī ti chando_, _asmī ti_ is adjectival and we call it
'egocentric,' which produces a comprehensible translation. In comparison, Bodhi
persistently calls it "I am" as follows:

- 'there lingers in him a residual conceit "I am" (_asmī ti māno_), a desire
"I am" (_asmī ti chando_), an underlying tendency "I am" (_asmī ti anusayo_)
that have not yet been abolished' (CDB p.945).

===== Asmī ti māna and asmī ti anusayo in the quote just given

These have been rendered in the quotation as:

- _asmī ti māna_: self-centredness

- _asmī ti anusayo_: proclivity to self-centredness

We justify calling _asmi_ 'self-centredness' as follows:

Other suttas show that _māna_ equals the notion "I am" (_asmī ti bhikkhave
mānagatametaṃ_: S.4.202-3). This suggests that _asmimāno_ is a redundancy
(i.e. a compound of two equivalent terms), and that _asmimāno_ is a synonym of
_māno._ Therefore all three terms (_asmi_, _māna_, and _asmimāna_) do or can
mean 'self-centredness.' This is discussed further sv _Māna._

===== Differentiating the qualities of "I am"

"I am" is used by the ignorant Everyman but also by the arahant, who 'makes use
of conventional speech without grasping it' (_yañca loke vuttaṃ teneva
voharati aparāmasanti_) (S.1.14; M.1.500). But there seems no grammatical
device to indicate the different quality of their "I am's." Although the
_Taṇhājālinī Sutta_ (A.2.212-3) says the thought 'I am this way'
(_evamasmī ti hoti_) is imbued with _taṇhā_, this is obviously not true for
arahants' "I am's." The Buddha himself said:

[quote, It.101]
____
'I am a Brahman'

_ahamasmi bhikkhave brāhmaṇo._
____

[quote, Dh.v.353]
____
'I have understood the All'

_sabbavidu'hamasmi._
____

[quote, Vin.1.8]
____
'I am freed from inward distress'

_sītibhūtosmi._
____

Translators might like to indicate the non-ignorant quality of such I am's, but
how could this be done? One cannot possibly have the arahant say:

- 'I (conventionally speaking) am a Brahman'

- I (conventionally speaking) have understood the All etc.

Or have the common man say:

- 'I (grasped as such) am this way'

The context, however, makes it clear which "I am's" are likely imbued with
_taṇhā_, and which are not.

COMMENT:

_Asmī ti diṭṭhimānānusayaṃ_ is similar to Venerable Khemaka's _asmī
ti anusayo_ which we translated above as 'a proclivity to self-centredness.' We
consider that the two phrases are equivalent because:

1. _asmī ti_ and _māno_ are synonyms meaning self-centredness, and

2. because self-centredness is essentially a view, the word _diṭṭhi_ is
redundant.

Bodhi translates it as 'the underlying tendency to the view and conceit "I
am,"' and Horner 'addiction to the latent view "I am."'

notion "I am"; I am
====

The _Taṇhājālinī Sutta_ (A.2.212-3) lists 36 assertions of personal
identity which arise with the notion "I am." The sutta says when there is the
notion "I am" (_asmī ti bhikkhave sati_) there come the thoughts

- I am here _itthasmī ti hoti_

- I am this way _evamasmī ti hoti_

- I am otherwise _aññathasmī ti hoti_

and other similar thoughts.

The sutta continues: when there is the thought

'Because of this, I am' (_iminā asmī ti bhikkhave sati_) there come the
thoughts:

- Because of this, I am here _iminā itthasmī ti hoti_

- Because of this, I am this way _iminā evamasmī ti hoti_

- Because of this, I am otherwise _iminā aññathasmī ti hoti_

and other such thoughts (A.2.212-3).

=== Ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayā

==== Renderings

- _ahaṅkāramamaṅkāra mānānusayā_: the illusion of personal identity,
the illusion of personal ownership, and the proclivity to self-centredness

==== Introduction

===== Ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayā: others' translations

_Ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayā_ has been rendered as follows:

- Horner: 'the tendency to pride that "I am the doer, mine is the doer"' (MLS
Vol.3, p39).

- Bodhi: 'I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit' (MLDB
p.908).

- PED: _ahaṅkāra_ selfishness, egotism, arrogance; _mamaṅkāra_, selfish
attachment, self-interest, selfishness; _mān'ānusaya_ bias of conceit.

Horner uses inverted commas, but there is no support for inverted commas either
in the phrase itself, or even when it is divided up, as at (A.3.444
(_ahaṅkārā ca me uparujjhissanti; mamaṅkārā ca me uparujjhissanti_).

===== The suffix -kara

The suffix -_kāra_ has three possible meanings, says PED (sv -_kāra_):

1. 'Doer or maker of': for example, owl _uhuṅkāra_ is the maker of the 'uhu'
sound; fletcher _usukāra_ the maker of arrows (_usu_).

2. 'Production or application of': for example, _sakkāra_, application of
honour i.e. the act of honouring. Bodhi chooses this meaning, but with an
unnatural form: 'I-making, mine-making.'

3. 'State of': for example, darkness or blindness _andhakāra_. Darkness is the
'state of being dark', or the 'state of what is dark'. Blindness is the 'state
of being blind', or the 'state of one who is blind'.

===== Renderings for ahaṅkāra and mamaṅkāra

Various ways of rendering _ahaṅkāra_ and _mamaṅkāra_ could be extracted
from this.

1. 'The doer or maker of me and of mine': this is unlikely because
_ahaṅkāra_ and _mamaṅkāra_ need to be uprooted (_ahaṅkārā ca me
uparujjhissanti; mamaṅkārā ca me uparujjhissanti_). So, if anything, it
would be 'the assumption that there is a doer or maker' that would be uprooted.

2. 'The production of me or mine' (e.g. I-making, mine-making): But this would
similarly lead to the problematic idea of 'uprooting production.'

3. 'The state of what is me or what belongs to me': this option has most
potential. But _ahaṅkāra_ and _mamaṅkāra_ would be better as:

- _Ahaṅkāra_, the state of what is me: 'personal identity.'

- _Mamaṅkāra,_ the state of what belongs to me: 'personal ownership.'

But because _ahaṅkāra_ and _mamaṅkāra_ need to be uprooted (_ahaṅkārā
ca me uparujjhissanti; mamaṅkārā ca me uparujjhissanti_) these would work
better as:

- _Ahaṅkāra_, 'the illusion of personal identity.'

- _Mamaṅkāra,_ 'the illusion of personal ownership.'

===== Rendering mānānusayo

Finally, _mānānusayo_ is 'the proclivity to self-centredness.' See Glossary
sv _Anusaya_.

===== Link to the three reflections on the voidness of personal qualities [in the five aggregates]

Our rendering is supported by the following quote, in which:

1. 'The illusion of personal identity does not exist' (_ahaṅkāra na hoti_)
corresponds to 'perceiving the five aggregates as "not [in reality] what I am"'
(_n'eso'hamasmi_).

2. 'The illusion of personal ownership does not exist' (_mamaṅkāra na hoti_)
corresponds to 'perceiving the five aggregates as "not [in reality] mine"'
(_n'etaṃ mama_).

3. 'The proclivity to self-centredness does not exist' (_mānānusayā na
hoti_) corresponds to 'perceiving the five aggregates as "not my [absolute]
Selfhood"' (_na me so attā_).

The quote is this:

[quote, M.3.18-9]
____
Knowing and seeing what in this [wretched human] body together with its
advertence and all external phenomena, do the illusion of personal identity,
the illusion of personal ownership, and the proclivity to self-centredness not
exist?

_Kathaṃ pana bhante jānato kathaṃ passato imasmiñca saviññāṇake
kāye bahiddhā ca sabbanimittesu ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayā na
hontī ti?_

(...) Whatever bodily form... advertence, past, future, or present, internal
or external, gross or subtle, inferior or sublime, far or near, one perceives
all advertence according to reality with perfect penetrative discernment as
"not [in reality] mine," "not [in reality] what I am," "not my [absolute]
Selfhood."

_Yaṃ kiñci viññāṇaṃ atītānāgatapaccuppannaṃ ajjhattaṃ vā
bahiddhā vā oḷārikaṃ vā sukhumaṃ vā hīnaṃ vā paṇītaṃ vā
yaṃ dūre santike vā sabbaṃ viññāṇaṃ n'etaṃ mama n'eso'hamasmi na

- _natthi kiñcanaṃ_: there is [nowhere] anything at all

==== Introduction: ākiñcañña

===== Three meanings

_Ākiñcañña_ has three meanings:

1. nonexistence

2. the perception of nonexistence

3. possessionlessness

===== 1) Nonexistence

The meaning 'nonexistence,' can be seen in _ākiñcañña's_ relationship to
_natthi kiñcī ti_, the perception that there is [nowhere] anything at all, as
in this passage:

[quote, S.4.296]
____
He enters and abides in the state of awareness of nonexistence, where one
perceives that there is [nowhere] anything at all.

_natthi kiñcī ti ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati._
____

The same relationship between 'nonexistence' and 'the perception that there is
[nowhere] anything at all' can be seen when Venerable Posāla asked about the
knowledge of 'one who sees that there is [nowhere] anything at all' (_natthi
kiñcī ti passato_ Sn.v.1113). The Buddha referred to this as 'knowing the
arising of nonexistence [according to reality]' (_ākiñcaññasambhavaṃ
ñatvā,_ Sn.v.1115):

[quote, Sn.v.1113]
____
-- I ask, Sakyan, about the knowledge of one whose perception of bodily form
has vanished, who has abandoned all bodily forms, who sees that there is
[nowhere] anything at all either internally or externally. How is such a person
to be led further?

_Vibhūtarūpasaññissa sabbakāyappahāyino +
Ajjhattañca bahiddhā ca natthi kiñcī ti passato +
Ñāṇaṃ sakkānupucchāmi kathaṃ neyyo tathā vidho._
____

[quote, Sn.v.1115]
____
-- Knowing the arising of nonexistence [according to reality], and knowing that
spiritually fettering delight is a tie to individual existence, knowing this
thus, then he sees this matter [according to reality]. This is the knowledge of
things according to reality of the Brahman who has perfected the religious life

_Ākiñcaññasambhavaṃ ñatvā nandi saṃyojanaṃ iti +
Evametaṃ abhiññāya tato tattha vipassati: +
Etaṃ ñāṇaṃ tathaṃ tassa brāhmaṇassa vusīmato ti._
____

The phrase 'either internally or externally' supports us parenthesising
'[nowhere] anything.'

===== 2) The perception of nonexistence

The meaning 'the perception of nonexistence' can be seen where
_ākiñcaññaṃ_ is linked to _natthī ti_ when the Buddha told Venerable
Upasīva that being intent upon the perception of nonexistence
(_ākiñcaññaṃ pekkhamāno_) means with the help of the reflection 'It does
not exist':

[quote, Sn.v.1070]
____
Being intent upon the perception of nonexistence, being mindful, with the help
of the reflection 'It does not exist,' cross the flood [of suffering].

_Ākiñcaññaṃ pekkhamāno satimā natthī ti nissāya tarassu oghaṃ._
____

===== 3) A state of possessionlessness

_Ākiñcaññaṃ_'s third meaning is possessionlessness. For example, the
bhikkhunī Subhā (Thī.v.341) reflecting on a return to the household life
said:

[quote, Thī.v.341]
____
It would be unseemly for me, longing for a state of possessionlessness,

_Na metaṃ assa patirūpaṃ ākiñcaññaṃ hi patthaye_

(...) Having junked gold and silver, to take them back again.

_Yo jātarūpaṃ rajataṃ chaḍḍetvā puna-r-āgahe._
____

Possessionlessness means either:

1. having minimal possessions. For example, the brahman Bāvari, longing for a
state of possessionlessness, lived on gleanings and fruit (Sn.v.976-982).

2. Or it means having no luxurious possessions. For example, Subhā 'junked
gold and silver.'

These meanings are practically equivalent.

==== Illustrations: ākiñcaññaṃ

====
ākiñcaññaṃ

[quote, A.2.177]
____
The Brahman speaks thus

_brāhmaṇo evamāha_

'I am not in any way anything "belonging to anyone"; and not in any way is
there anywhere anything "belonging to me."'

_nāhaṃ kvacani kassaci kiñcanatasmiṃ +
na ca mama kvacani katthaci kiñcanatātthī ti_

In fully understanding the truth of this saying one is applied to the practice
of possessionlessness.

_api ca yadeva tattha saccaṃ tadabhiññāya ākiñcaññaṃ yeva
paṭipadaṃ paṭipanno hoti._
____

Comment:

The _Uposatha Sutta_ (A.1.206) says the particular application of this
contemplation is in personal relationships, where usually a man's parents know
him as their son, and he knows them as his parents (_ayaṃ amhākaṃ putto ti
so pi jānāti ime mayhaṃ mātāpitaro ti_). Similarly, his slaves and
servants know him as their master, and he knows them as his slaves and servants
(_ayaṃ amhākaṃ ayyo ti. So pi jānāti ime mayhaṃ dāsakammakaraporisā
ti_). This reflection therefore overcomes the idea that beings possess each
other.

====
ākiñcaññaṃ

a state of possessionlessness
====

The brahman Bāvari, longing for a state of possessionlessness
(_ākiñcaññaṃ patthayāno_), lived on gleanings and fruit. When someone
asked him for money, Bāvari said:

[quote, Sn.v.982]
____
'Whatever I had that was suitable for offering has all been disposed of by me'

_yaṃ kho mamaṃ deyyadhammaṃ sabbaṃ vissajjitaṃ mayā._
____

Possessionless therefore means having nothing suitable for offering to others.

==== Introduction: akiñcana

===== Akiñcana: meanings

_Akiñcana_ has four meanings:

1. liberated from the perception of existence

2. free of the perception of existence

3. possessionless

4. destitute

===== Relation to ākiñcaññā: liberated from the perception of existence

_Akiñcanaṃ_ is related to _ākiñcaññā_, which we have seen above can
mean 'the perception of nonexistence,' and _akiñcanaṃ_ shares this meaning
because _akiñcanaṃ_ describes:

[quote, Sn.v.645]
____
'A person for whom there is [nowhere] anything at all in either the past, the
future, or the present,

_Yassa pure ca pacchā ca majjhe ca natthi kiñcanaṃ_

(...) Who is liberated from the perception of existence, free of grasping, he is
what I call a Brahman.

_Akiñcanaṃ anādānaṃ tamahaṃ brūmi brāhmaṇaṃ._
____

_Akiñcanaṃ_ therefore means 'liberated from the perception of existence.' We
will consider _natthi kiñcanaṃ_ below.

===== Relation to ākiñcaññā: free of the perception of existence

In relation to _nibbāna_, _akiñcana_ must be rendered as 'free of the
perception of existence':

[quote, Sn.v.1093-4]
____
This Island, supreme, free of the perception of existence, free of grasping, I
call it the Untroubled, the destruction of old age and death.

_Akiñcanaṃ anādānaṃ etaṃ dipaṃ anaparaṃ +
Nibbānaṃ iti taṃ brūmi jarāmaccuparikkhayaṃ._
____

===== Relation to ākiñcaññā: possessionless

We have seen that _ākiñcaññaṃ_ means possessionlessness, and again,
_akiñcanaṃ_ shares this meaning. For example:

[quote, D.3.171]
____
Possessionless, gone forth [into the ascetic life]

_Akiñcanaṃ pabbajitaṃ._
____

[quote, A.5.232]
____
Having abandoned sensuous pleasures, being possessionless, one who is wise
should cleanse himself of spiritual defilements.

_hitvā kāme akiñcano pariyodapeyya attānaṃ cittaklesehi paṇḍito._
____

===== Relation to ākiñcaññā: destitution

Related to possessionlessness is destitution:

[quote, D.3.185]
____
The drunkard is broke and destitute

_Yo vāruṇī adhano akiñcano._
____

==== Illustrations: akiñcano

==== Introduction: kiñcanaṃ and kiñci

===== Kiñcana and kiñci: meanings

We will show in this section that the synonyms _kiñcana_ and _kiñci_ have
these meanings:

1. _kiñcana_: something

2. _kiñci_: something

3. _kiñcana_: anything at all

4. _sakiñcana_: attached to the perception of existence

5. _kiñcana_: attachment to the perception of existence

6. _kiñci_: attachment to the perception of existence

===== 1) kiñcana: something

In the scriptures, _na... kiñcana_ ordinarily means 'nothing':

- 'There is nothing in the world (na... _kiñcanamatthi loke_) which has not
been seen, heard, sensed, or cognised by you' (Sn.v.1122).

===== 2) kiñci: something

_Kiñci_ equals _kiñcana_ says PED, which can be seen here:

[quote, S.2.100]
____
There is nothing further that a noble disciple needs to do

_ariyasāvakassa natthi kiñci uttariṃ karaṇīyanti._
____

===== 3) Kiñcana: anything at all

We have seen that _kiñcana_ and _kiñci_ can mean 'something.' But sometimes
_kiñcana_ is better as 'anything at all':

[quote, S.1.12]
____
One should not do anything at all anywhere that is unvirtuous by body, speech,
or mind.

_Pāpaṃ na kayirā vacasā manasā kāyena vā kiñcana sabbaloke._
____

[quote, Sn.v.951]
____
One for whom there is no thought of anything at all, 'This is mine,' or, 'This
belongs to others,'

_Yassa natthi idaṃ meti paresaṃ vāpi kiñcanaṃ._
____

===== 4) Sakiñcano: attached to the perception of existence

_Sakiñcanaṃ_ is sometimes contrasted with _akiñcanā_:

[quote, Ud.14]
____
How pleasant it is, for one who is _akiñcanā_... See how they are troubled,
those who are _sakiñcanaṃ_

_sukhino vata ye akiñcanā... sakiñcanaṃ passa vihaññamānaṃ._
____

And since we have already shown that _akiñcanā_ can mean 'liberated from the
perception of existence,' _sakiñcanaṃ_ would mean 'attached to the
perception of existence.' Thus the passage should read:

[quote, Ud.14]
____
How pleasant it is, for one who is liberated from the perception of existence,

_Sukhino vata ye akiñcanā_

Those who are blessed with profound knowledge are indeed people liberated from
the perception of existence

_Vedaguno hi janā akiñcanā_

See how they are troubled, those who are attached to the perception of
existence.

_Sakiñcanaṃ passa vihaññamānaṃ_

Man is emotionally bound to man.

_Jano janasmiṃ paṭibaddhacitto ti._
____

===== 5) Kiñcana: attachment to the perception of existence'

If _sakiñcanaṃ_ can mean 'attached to the perception of existence' by
extension, _kiñcana_ can mean 'attachment to the perception of existence,' for
example here:

[quote, D.3.217]
____
Three forms of attachment to the perception of existence:

_tayo kiñcanā_

(...) attachment is attachment to the perception of existence,

_rāgo kiñcanaṃ_

(...) hatred is attachment to the perception of existence,

_doso kiñcanaṃ_

(...) undiscernment of reality is attachment to the perception of existence

_moho kiñcanaṃ._

===== 6) Na hoti kiñci: to have no attachment to the perception of existence

But _sakiñcanaṃ_ is sometimes contrasted with _na hoti kiñci_:

[quote, Ud.13]
____
How pleasant it is, for one who _na hoti kiñci..._ See how they are troubled,
those who are _sakiñcanaṃ_

_sukhaṃ vata tassa na hoti kiñci... sakiñcanaṃ passa vihaññamānaṃ_
____

According to this, _na hoti kiñci_ is equivalent to _akiñcanā_, implying
that, like _kiñcana, kiñci_ can also mean 'attachment to the perception of
existence.' Thus the quote can be translated like this:

[quote, Ud.13]
____
How pleasant it is, for one with no attachment to the perception of existence,
who has mastered the teaching, who is learned. See how they are troubled, those
who are attached to the perception of existence. Man is emotionally bound to
man.

himself a Brahman] is simply a snob.

one can develop [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill for that person

one can arouse unmindfulness and inattention regarding him

_asati amanisikāro tasmiṃ puggale āpajjitabbā_

- _ātappaṃ karoti_: to vigorously apply oneself [to the practice]

- _ātappaṃ karoti_: to vigorously endeavour

==== Introduction

===== Ātāpin: vigorously

_Ātāpin_ has been called 'ardent' since 1875 when Childer's dictionary was
published, which means 'enthusiastic.' But the scriptures more strongly suggest
'vigorous' or 'vigorously,' and DOP appropriately calls it 'energetic.' But,
two points:

1. It usually an adverb, so it mostly means 'vigorously' not 'vigorous.'

2. Its link to various qualifiers show that it is an abbreviation, and must be
parenthesised in translation.

===== Ātāpin: three qualifiers

We parenthesise _ātāpin_ in accordance with suttas where it is linked to some
qualifier. In the following examples it is linked to 'inward striving'
'contemplating' and 'practising the teaching'. It is from the last ('practising
as I instructed him') that we render it as 'vigorously applied [to the
practice]':

=== Ādiccabandhu

==== Renderings

- _ādiccabandhu_: the [enlightened] kinsman of the Sun clan

==== Introduction

===== Ādiccabandhu: the kinsman of the Sun clan

_Ādiccā_ is a synonym for _suriyo_, sun (D.3.196). It was also the name of
the Buddha's clan, the Sun Clan (_ādiccā nāma gottena_, Sn.v.423; see
discussion in Buddhist Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names). Therefore when the
Buddha was called Ādiccabandhu, it meant he was 'the kinsman of the Sun clan.'

===== Misrendering: 'kinsman of the sun'

But _Ādiccabandhu_ is often rendered as 'the kinsman of the sun' (reading
'sun' instead of 'Sun clan') as if to praise the Buddha for being related to
the sun. But glorifying the sun in this way, and suggesting that the Buddha is
related to it, is ridiculously suggestive of sun veneration, or even veneration
of ancestors. In any case the Buddha rated himself as higher than the sun, and
would certainly reject the idea that his worthiness was due to his forefathers.
He said there are four sources of light in the world: the sun, the moon, fire,
and the Buddha, and added that:

[quote, S.1.15]
____
The Buddha is the best of those that shine, the light unsurpassed

_sambuddho tapataṃ seṭṭho esā ābhā anuttarā ti._
____

===== Linked: buddha and ādiccabandhu

The word _ādiccabandhu_ occurs 29 times in the scriptures, always in verse. On
19 occasions it is linked to _buddhaṃ_, in the following ways:

- _buddhaṃ ādiccabandhunaṃ_: 8 occurrences (Āṭānāṭiya Sutta, D.3.197).
- _buddhamādiccabandhunaṃ_: 1 occurrence (Sakkapañha Sutta, D.2.287).
- _buddhassādiccabandhuno_: 3 occurrences, genitive
- _buddhenādiccabandhunā_: 6 occurrences, instrumental

The cases always match. The -_unaṃ_ suffix is unusual, but functions as an
accusative singular. It occurs in the following contexts:

[quote, D.2.287]
____
I pay homage to the great Hero, to the enlightened kinsman of the Sun clan.

_ahaṃ vande mahāvīraṃ buddhamādiccabandhunaṃ._
____

[quote, D.3.197]
____
Even from afar venerate the enlightened kinsman of the Sun clan.

_buddhaṃ ādiccabandhunaṃ dūrato'va namassanti._
____

===== Restoring the buddha prefix

Where _ādiccabandhu_ occurs without a _buddha_ prefix, it is likely an
abbreviation for metrical reasons, and in translation the _buddha_ prefix
should always be restored, and _ādiccabandhu_ should always be rendered as
'the enlightened kinsman of the Sun clan.' This would be a satisfactory
conclusion. Praising the Buddha for simply being a kinsman of the Sun clan
would be praise equally due to his cousin, Devadatta. In which case, Sn.v.54
should be translated as follows:

[quote, Sn.v.54]
____
Having heard the word of the [enlightened] kinsman of the Sun clan, one should
live the religious life as solitarily as a rhinoceros horn.'

_Ādiccabandhussa vaco nisamma +
Eko care khaggavisāṇakappo._
____

===== The Buddha, the Buddha

That _buddhaṃ_ is meant as an adjective not a noun explains the awkward
doubling of _buddhaṃ_ in the _Āṭānāṭiya Sutta_ (D.3.197), which
interpreted as 1) a noun or 2) an adjective, would have the following results:

1. They, seeing the Buddha, the Buddha, the kinsman of the Sun clan, even from
afar venerate him.'
+
****
_Te cā pi buddhaṃ disvāna buddhaṃ ādiccabandhunaṃ +

It would be better for the faculty of sight to be blotted out by a red-hot iron
pin, burning, blazing, and glowing, than for one to grasp the features or
aspects of a visible object known via the visual sense.

For if one's stream of sense consciousness should stand tied to the sweetness
of the features or aspects of the object, and if one should die on that
occasion, it is possible that one will go to one of two places of rebirth: hell
or the animal realm.

When a person's complete faith is based on a single individual (_puggale

community of bhikkhus suspends him, then he will think: 'The community of
bhikkhus has suspended he who is beloved and dear to me.' And he will be no
more full of faith in the bhikkhus (_bhikkhūsu appasādabahulo hoti_), and
from being without faith he will not follow other bhikkhus, and from not
following other bhikkhus he will not hear the true teaching, and from not

reborn. It is neither fixed, nor moving, and has no foundation. This is truly
the end of suffering.

Comment:

_Saḷāyatananirodhaṃ_ means _nibbāna_ at A.2.161-2 (_channaṃ āvuso
phassāyatanānaṃ asesavirāganirodhā papañcanirodho_). Ānanda indicates
it has the same meaning here. This justifies us calling _āyatane_ 'that
supreme state of deliverance.'

Comment:

_Se āyatane_ is an Eastern form of Pāli, discussed by Bodhi: CDB p.1414
n.102).

[quote, M.2.262]
____
How about if I, by transcending the world [of sensuous pleasure] with resolve,
were to abide with an awareness that was abundant and enlarged? Having done so,
unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome mental states such as greed, ill will, and
aggressiveness would not exist. With their abandonment, my mind would become
immeasurable, unlimited, and well developed.

_Yaṃnūnāhaṃ vipulena mahaggatena cetasā vihareyyaṃ abhibhuyya lokaṃ
adhiṭṭhāya manasā. Vipulena hi me mahaggatena cetasā viharato abhibhuyya
lokaṃ adhiṭṭhāya manasā ye pāpakā akusalā mānasā abhijjhāpi

Applying himself and frequently abiding in this way, his mind becomes serene
through that practice of spiritual development.

There are eight practices of spiritual development that lead to mastery
(_aṭṭha abhibhāyatanāni_), Ānanda. What eight?

_Aṭṭha kho imāni ānanda abhibhāyatanāni. Katamāni aṭṭha?_

Being in a refined material state of awareness, one sees a limited quantity of
shapes, beautiful or ugly. By gaining mastery over them, one is aware that one
knows and sees them [according to reality]. This is the first practice of
spiritual development leading to mastery.

_Ajjhattaṃ rūpasaññī eko bahiddhā rūpāni passati parittāni

occasions

[quote, A.3.21]
____
There are five occasions of liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]
(_vimuttāyatanāni_) in which, for a bhikkhu abiding diligently, vigorously,
and resolutely applied [to the practice], his unliberated mind is liberated
[from perceptually obscuring states], his undestroyed perceptually obscuring
states are destroyed, the unreached safety from the danger of bondage [to
individual existence] is reached. Which five?_

_Pañcimāni bhikkhave vimuttāyatanāni yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa
ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati
aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti ananuppattaṃ vā
anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇāti. Katamāni pañca?_

In the first case, a teacher explains the Buddha's teaching

_satthā dhammaṃ deseti_

The bhikkhu accordingly realises the meaning and significance of the teaching _

_tathā tathā so tasmiṃ dhamme atthappaṭisaṃvedī ca hoti
dhammapaṭisaṃvedī ca_

gladness arises

_Tassa atthappaṭisaṃvedino dhammappaṭisaṃvedino pāmujjaṃ jāyati_

from this, rapture

_pamuditassa pīti jāyati_

from this his body becomes tranquil

_pītimanassa kāyo passambhati_

from this he experiences physical pleasure

_passaddhakāyo sukhaṃ vedeti_

from this, his mind becomes collected

_sukhino cittaṃ samādhiyati._

This is the first occasion of liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]_

_Idaṃ bhikkhave paṭhamaṃ vimuttāyatanaṃ yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa
ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati
aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti ananuppattaṃ vā
anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇāti._

(The other occasions are:)

in the course of explaining the teaching to others in detail as he has heard
and memorised it

_yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena paresaṃ deseti_

as he is reciting the teaching.

_yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ vitthārena sajjhāyaṃ karoti_

when he applies his mind to the teaching, thinks about and ponders it, and
concentrates his attention on it.

_yathāsutaṃ yathāpariyattaṃ dhammaṃ cetasā anuvitakketi anuvicāreti
manasānupekkhati._

Some assert that the _attā_ is unperceptive and unimpaired after death.

_asaññī attā hoti arogo parammaraṇā ti ittheke abhivadanti_

Some assert that the _attā_ is neither perceptive nor unperceptive and
unimpaired after death.

_nevasaññīnāsaññī attā hoti arogo parammaraṇā ti ittheke abhivadanti_

Or they assert the annihilation, destruction, and cessation of cessation of

_sato vā pana sattassa ucchedaṃ vināsaṃ vibhavaṃ paññapenti_

Or they proclaim a view concerning the highest pleasure in this lifetime.

_Diṭṭhadhammanibbānaṃ vā paneke abhivadanti_

Thus they either assert an _attā_ that is unimpaired after death

_iti santaṃ vā attānaṃ paññāpenti arogaṃ parammaraṇā._

Or they assert the annihilation, destruction, and cessation of beings [at death]

+
****
_satthehi ca pādehi ca vāyāmo ti kho bhikkhave viriyārambhassetaṃ
adhivacanaṃ_ (It.114).

1. Speaking aggressively in relation to views, they do not transcend the round
of birth and death.
+
****
_Diṭṭhisu sārambhakathā saṃsāraṃ nātivattatī ti_ (Ud.70).

is unpleasant. Retaliation might befall you.

****
Dukkhā hi sārambhakathā paṭidaṇḍā phuseyyuṃ taṃ_ (Dh.v.133).

3. Sensuous pleasures in this lifetime; sensuous pleasures in the hereafter...

****

===== 'Harmful conduct'

In some circumstances, _ārambha, _samārambha_, and _sārambha_ can mean
'harmful conduct'. This meaning is acknowledged in DOP under _Ārambha_, and
called 'wrongly directed exertion or action'. This is close in meaning to
_akusala_, and could therefore be called 'spiritually unwholesome conduct.' But
because the three words usually mean 'aggression' and 'slaughter,' we prefer
'harmful conduct.' We illustrate this as follows:

1. _Ārambha_: harmful conduct
+
[quote, Sn.v.744]
____
Whatever suffering arises, all of it arises dependent on harmful conduct. That
is the first consideration.

_Yaṃ kiñci dukkhaṃ sambhoti sabbaṃ ārambhapaccayā ti.
Ayamekānupassanā_

With the complete fading away and ending of harmful conduct, there is no
arising of suffering. That is the second consideration.

_arambhānaṃ tveva asesavirāganirodhā natthi dukkhassa sambhavo ti. Ayaṃ
dutiyānupassanā._
____

2. _Samārambha_: harmful conduct
+
[quote, A.2.197-8]
____
As to those vexatious and anguishing perceptually obscuring states that arise
due to harmful conduct of body, in the case of one who abstains from such
harmful conduct of body, it follows that those vexatious and anguishing
perceptually obscuring states do not exist in him.

_ye kāyasamārambhapaccayā uppajjanti āsavā vighātapariḷāhā
kāyasamārambhā paṭiviratassa evaṃsa te āsavā vighātapariḷāhā na
honti._
____

3. _Sārambha_: harmful conduct
+
[quote, Th.v.37]
____
They go to different countries, wandering unrestrained. If they lose their
inward collectedness, what good will this international travelling do?
Therefore one should eliminate [such] harmful conduct. One should meditate
unaccompanied.

_Nānājanapadaṃ yanti vicarantā asaṃyatā +
Samādhiñca virādhenti kiṃsu raṭṭhacariyā karissati +
Tasmā vineyya sārambhaṃ jhāyeyya apurakkhato ti._
____

===== Samārambha's two minor meanings:

_Samārambha_ has two minor meanings. 'Onerous' is unsurprising, being close in
meaning to _ārambha_, exertion. But 'arrangement' is indeed unexpected.

1. _Samārambha_: onerous (i.e. a food offering is less onerous than an animal
sacrifice):
+
[quote, D.1.144]
____
The perpetual offerings made by families which are dedicated to virtuous
ascetics, is a sacrifice less difficult and less onerous and is of more fruit
and more benefit than the [animal] sacrifice with its three modes and sixteen
accessories.

_Yāni kho pana tāni brāhmaṇa niccadānāni anukūlayaññāni sīlavanne
pabbajite uddissa dīyanti ayaṃ kho brāhmaṇa yañño imāya tividhāya
yaññasampadāya soḷasaparikkhārāya appaṭṭataro ca appasamārambhataro
ca mahapphalataro ca mahānisaṃsataro cā ti._
____

2. _Samārambha_: arrangement
+
[quote, Vin.4.67]
____
If any bhikkhu knowingly eats almsfood which a bhikkhunī has caused to be
prepared, unless there was a prior arrangement with the householder, this is an
offence of pācittiya.

_Yo pana bhikkhu jānaṃ bhikkhunīparipācitaṃ piṇḍapātaṃ bhuñjeyya
aññatra pubbe gihīsamārambhā pācittiyan ti._
____
+
'Arrangement' is explained in the word commentary as follows:
+
[quote, Vin.4.67]
____
An arrangement with the householder means: either they are one's relatives, or
[the bhikkhus] were [previously] invited, or [the meal] is ordinarily
[scheduled to be] prepared for the bhikkhu.

=== Ārammaṇa

==== Renderings

- _ārammaṇa_: basis [for spiritual development]

- _ārammaṇa_: basis

- _ārammaṇa_: basis [for the establishment of one's stream of sense
consciousness]

- _ārammaṇa_: foundation

- _ārammaṇa_: object of mindfulness

- _ārammaṇa_: opportunity [to attack]

==== Introduction

===== Primary meaning

The primary meaning of _ārammaṇa_ is 'foundation,' says PED.

===== Basis [for the establishment of one's stream of sense consciousness]

In this quote we parenthesise _ārammaṇā_ as 'bases [for the establishment
of his stream of sense consciousness]':

[quote, Sn.v.477]
____
He for whom there are no bases whatsoever [for the establishment of his stream
of sense consciousness]: the Perfect One is worthy of the oblation.

_Ārammaṇā yassa na santi keci tathāgato arahati pūraḷāsaṃ._
____

Reasons:

1. The commentary says: _Ārammaṇā ti paccayā punabbhavakāraṇānī ti
vuttaṃ hoti_.

2. This suggests that _ārammaṇaṃ viññāṇassa ṭhitiyā_ is meant, a
phrase which occurs here, where _ārammaṇaṃ_ is linked to _punabbhava_:

[quote, S.2.65]
____
Whatever one is intent upon, conceives of, and identifies with, this becomes
the basis for the establishment of one's stream of sense consciousness.

_yañca bhikkhave ceteti yañca pakappeti yañca anuseti ārammaṇametaṃ
hoti viññāṇassa ṭhitiyā_

(...) When there is the basis, there is the establishment of one's stream of
sense consciousness.

_Yañca ārammaṇe sati patiṭṭhā viññāṇassa hoti._

(...) When one's stream of sense consciousness is established and has
[egoistically] matured, renewed states of individual existence and rebirth
occur in the future.

_Tasmiṃ patiṭṭhite viññāṇe virūḷhe āyatiṃ
punabbhavābhinibbatti hoti._
____

===== Basis [for spiritual development]

'Basis [for spiritual development]' suits many contexts. See Illustrations.

===== Object of mindfulness

Sometimes _ārammaṇa_ means 'object of mindfulness'. For example, when
Tāḷapuṭa addressed his mind:

[quote, Th.v.1141]
____
I shall bind you to the object of mindfulness by force as one binds an elephant
to a post with a firm rope.

_ārammaṇe taṃ balasā nibandhisaṃ nāgaṃ va thambhamhi daḷhāya rajjuyā._
____

To support us calling _ārammaṇa_ 'object of mindfulness,' the following
passage concerns the same themes, of binding an elephant to a post, and where
the mind is tied to the four bases of mindfulness (_cattāro
satipaṭṭhānā_). But because _bandhati_ Th.v.1141 takes a locative,
_ārammaṇe_ is locative singular, not accusative plural, and does not mean
_cattāro satipaṭṭhānā_. Norman accordingly says, 'I shall bind you to
the meditation-base by force.'

[quote, M.3.136]
____
As, Aggivessana, an elephant tamer, driving a great post into the ground, ties
a forest elephant to it by his neck so as to subdue his forest ways, so as to

fatigue, and anguish at leaving the forest, so as to make him pleased with
villages and make him take delight in human ways. Even so, Aggivessana, these
four bases of mindfulness are to tie the mind so as to subdue the ways of
householders and to subdue the memories and thoughts of householders and to
subdue the suffering, fatigue, and anguish of householders; they are for
acquiring the noble practice, and for realising the Untroubled.

=== Āsava

==== Renderings

- _āsava_ (singular): perceptual obscuration

- _āsavā_ (plural): perceptually obscuring states

- _kāmāsava_: perceptual obscuration due to pursuing sensuous pleasure

- _bhavāsava_: perceptual obscuration due to pursuing individual existence

- _avijjāsava_: perceptual obscuration due to uninsightfulness into reality

- _sāsava_: associated with perceptually obscuring states

- _khīṇāsava_: one whose _āsavas_ are destroyed

Singular forms of _āsava_ commonly indicate the uncountable noun ('perceptual
obscuration'). Plural forms indicate the countable noun ('perceptually
obscuring states').

==== Introduction

===== On translating 'āsava'

- The PED says _āsavas_ 'intoxicate the mind, bemuddle it, befoozle it, so
that it cannot rise to higher things' but it admits the 'difficulty of
translating the term.'

- Horner says _āsava_ has 'always been a problem to translators'
(MLS.1.xxiii). She calls it 'canker' because 'I have come on no other
translation that seems preferable,' and by which she means 'anything that
frets, corrodes, corrupts, or consumes slowly and secretly.'

- Mrs. Rhys Davids also accepts 'canker.' She says that in canker 'we lose the
liquid meaning, the permeation, as of ink on blotting-paper, and which is kept
in view in "intoxicants," "drugs," "floods," "poisons"' (GS.3.ix).

But because _āsavas_ are defiling (_saṅkilesikā_), they are sometimes
called 'taints.' And sometimes the word is left untranslated, for example by
Norman (in _The Group of Discourses_), by Malalasekera (in _The Buddhist
Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names_) and even by the Pāli dictionaries
themselves. For example, the DOP renderings are:

- _āsavakkhaya_: 'destruction of the _āsavas_'

- _āsavakhīṇa_: 'with _āsavas_ destroyed; free of the _āsavas_'

- _āsavaṭṭhānīya_, being a basis or cause of the _āsavas_

- _anāsava_: 'free of the _āsavas_'

- _sāsava_: 'connected with the _āsavas_'

===== Primary sense: outflow and intoxicating product

The 'liquid meaning' is supported by the primary sense of _āsava_, which is
found as an alternative reading in certain Pāli editions, namely 'discharge
from a sore.' This is illustrated in the following passage, where the PTS and
VRI alternative reading for _assandati_ (to ooze) is _āsavaṃ deti_ (to 'give
an outflow'):

[quote, A.1.127]
____
When a sore is beaten with a stick or shard, it oozes (or, 'gives an
outflow') all the more.

_duṭṭhārukā kaṭṭhena vā kaṭhalena vā ghaṭṭitā
bhiyyosomattāya assandati (āsavaṃ deti)._
____

However, _āsava_ has another primary sense, namely 'intoxicating product'
which can be seen in the definition of alcoholic spirits (_merayo_), as follows:

[quote, Vin.4.110]
____
Alcoholic spirits means the intoxicating product of flowers, fruits, honey,
sugar'

_Merayo nāma pupphāsavo phalāsavo madhvāsavo guḷāsavo._
____

T.W. Rhys Davids was unaware of this definition when in 1899 he said:

- 'Unfortunately, the word _āsava_ has not been yet found in its concrete,
primary, sense; unless indeed Buddhaghosa's statement (at Asl. 48) that well
seasoned spirituous liquors were called _āsavā_ be taken literally. It is
therefore impossible to be sure what is the simile that underlies the use of
the word in its secondary, ethical sense. Perhaps after all it is the idea of
overwhelming intoxication, and not of flood or taint or ooze, that we ought to
consider' (Dialogues.1.92 n.3).

When the Buddha was conversing with bhikkhus over the body of the inebriated
venerable Sāgata, he asked them:

[quote, Vin.4.110]
____
But would one have deranged perception (_visaññi assā_) if one drunk only
that which may be drunk?"

_Api nu kho bhikkhave taṃ pātabbaṃ yaṃ pivitvā visaññi assā ti._
____

If _āsava_ is the basis of alcoholic deranged perception, the same term was
likely used in reference to the spiritual defilements that are the bases of the
mental derangement that we will call 'perceptual obscuration,' concerning which
the Buddha said:

[quote, A.2.143]
____
Those beings are hard to find in the world who can claim to be free of mental
illness even for a moment except the one whose _āsavas_ are destroyed.

_Te bhikkhave sattā dullabhā lokasmiṃ ye cetasikena rogena muhuttampi
ārogyaṃ paṭijānanti aññatra khīṇāsavehi._
____

===== The obscuring nature of āsavas

In this Glossary _āsavas_ are called 'perceptually obscuring states' (plural)
or perceptual obscuration (singular) because of the obscuring role they play in
perception, and which is illustrated in _paṭiccasamuppāda_, as follows:

[quote, M.1.46-56]
____
With the origination of perceptual obscuration comes the origination of
uninsightfulness into reality

_āsavasamudayā avijjāsamudayo._
____

The obscuring role of _āsavas_ is also described in terms of _sammūḷho,_
like this:

[quote, M.1.250]
____
It is through the non-abandonment of perceptually obscuring states that one is
undiscerning of reality

_Āsavānaṃ hi aggivessana appahānā sammūḷho hoti._
____

[quote, M.1.250]
____
It is through the abandonment of perceptually obscuring states that one is
discerning of reality.

_Āsavānaṃ hi aggivessana pahānā asammūḷho hoti._
____

===== Singulars and plurals

In the scriptures, _āsava_ moves freely between singulars and plurals. For
example, the _Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta_ (M.1.55) asks:

____
And what is perceptual obscuration? What is the origin of perceptual
obscuration?

_Katamo panāvuso āsavo? Katamo āsavasamudayo?_
____

The answer is:

____
There are these three perceptually obscuring states:

_Tayo'me āvuso āsavā_
____

1. perceptual obscuration due to pursuing sensuous pleasure
+
****
_kāmāsavo_
****

2. perceptual obscuration due to pursuing individual existence
+
****
_bhavāsavo_
****

3. perceptual obscuration due to uninsightfulness into reality
+
****
_avijjāsavo_.
****

Horner stays true to the singular/plural, but the result is awkward, and her
translation stumbles in the opening questions, which involve an uncountable
noun, not a countable noun:

- 'And what, your reverences, is a canker? What the uprising of a canker?.'..
Your reverences, there are these three cankers: the canker of sense-pleasures,
the canker of becoming, the canker of ignorance.'

Bodhi deals with the problem by pluralising:

- 'And what are the taints? What is the origin of the taints? There are these
three taints: the taint of sensuous desire, the taint of being, and the taint
of ignorance.'

But Pāli grammars do not support pluralising. This counts against most
renderings of _āsava_ because they are unuseable without it, including:
'intoxicants,' 'drugs,' 'floods,' 'poisons.'

===== How many āsavas?

In the scriptures there are two categories of _āsavas_:

1. A broad, undefined category which includes a wide range of defilements. The
_pañca nīvaraṇā_ are practically part of this category. This category of
_āsavas_ are gradually worn down from stream-entry onwards. We will discuss
these points in due course.

2. A narrow, well-defined category which is clearly differentiated from the
_pañca nīvaraṇā_ and occurs in the scriptures only in relation to
arahantship. In this narrow, well-defined category there are three _āsavas_:
_kāmāsavo bhavāsavo_ and _avijjāsavo. Diṭṭhāsavo_ is controversial. It
occurs just once in the scriptures (at A.4.179), and in a note to this passage
(NDB n.1649) Bodhi says the word occurs only in the Sinhala edition, not the
Roman or Burmese editions. Furthermore, elsewhere in the Sinhala edition,
parallel passages make no reference to _diṭṭhāsavo_. Thus the occurrence
at A.4.179 is likely interpolative. Hence, like Bodhi, we discount it.

===== The connective in kāmāsavo, bhavāsavo, and avijjāsavo

The terms _kāmāsavo bhavāsavo_ and _avijjāsavo_ are commonly translated
with the connective 'of.' For example, Bodhi says 'the taint of sensuality,'
'the taint of existence' and 'the taint of ignorance.' But the scriptures say
the connective is _paccayā_ 'due to.' For example, in the _Vappa Sutta_
(A.2.196-7) the Buddha divides _āsavas_ into two groups:

1. _āsavas_ which arise due to harmful conduct of body, speech, or mind
(_kāya... vacī... manosamārambhapaccayā uppajjanti āsavā_) and which do
not exist in one who abstains from such endeavours (_kāya... vacī...
manosamārambhā paṭiviratassa evaṃsa te āsavā vighātapariḷāhā na
honti_).

2. _āsavas_ which arise due to _avijjā_ (_avijjāpaccayā uppajjanti
āsavā_) and when _avijjā_ vanishes and _vijjā_ arises (_avijjāvirāgā
vijjuppādā_), those vexatious and anguishing _āsavas_ do not exist in him
(_evaṃsa te āsavā vighātapariḷāhā na honti_).

===== Translating kāmāsavo, bhavāsavo, and avijjāsavo

The twofold division of the _Vappa Sutta_ should be compared to the usual
threefold division (D.3.216), namely:

1. _kāmāsavo_

2. _bhavāsavo_

3. _avijjāsavo_

Here, _avijjāsavo_ corresponds to _avijjāpaccayā uppajjanti āsavā_, and
_kāmāsavo_ and _bhavāsavo_ would then necessarily correspond to _kāya...
vacī... manosamārambhapaccayā uppajjanti āsavā_ because the division is
comprehensive_._ There are no _āsavas_ outside this twofold division. We infer
from this that:

- _avijjāsavo_ means the _āsavo_ that arises due to _avijjā._

- _kāmāsavo_ means the _āsavo_ that arises due to endeavour by body,
speech, or mind in relation to sensuous pleasure, which we will call 'the
_āsava_ due to pursuing sensuous pleasure.'

- _bhavāsavo_ means the _āsavo_ that arises due to endeavour by body,
speech, or mind in relation to states of individual existence, which we will
call 'the _āsava_ due to pursuing individual existence.'

Because we render _āsava_ as 'perceptual obscuration,' these become:

- _avijjāsavo_: perceptual obscuration due to _avijjā._

- _kāmāsavo_: perceptual obscuration due to pursuing sensuous pleasure.'

- _bhavāsavo_: perceptual obscuration due to pursuing individual existence.

Here the sources of _āsavas_ are not themselves _āsavas_. Thus _avijjāsava_
does not mean the _āsava_ of _avijjā_ but the _āsava_ due to _avijjā_; and
so on. This is in accordance with _paṭiccasamuppāda_ which says _āsava_ is
due to _avijjā_ (_avijjāsamudayā āsavasamudayo_ (M.1.55).

We also see that _āsavas_ are either _paccayā uppajjanti āsavā_ ('_āsavas_
due to') or _samārambhapaccayā uppajjanti āsavā_ ('_āsavas_ due to
pursuing') the former occurring with _avijjā_ the latter with acts of body,
speech, and mind (_kāya... vacī... mano_).

===== Translating āsavā plural

In the cases above, _āsava_ is in the singular case, indicating a state of
perceptual obscuration (singular) due to some condition. But in the
_Nissāraṇīya Sutta_ (A.3.245) the _āsavas_ are _paccayā uppajjanti
āsavā_ indicating perceptually obscuring states (plural) due to some
condition. We have seen above that, when not associated with _avijjā, āsavas_
are _samārambhapaccayā uppajjanti āsavā,_ i.e. 'perceptually obscuring
states that arise due to pursuing.' But in relation to mental factors like ill
will or maliciousness, to have these states is to pursue them. Therefore we
will refer to 'perceptually obscuring states that arise due to ill will or
maliciousness' rather than 'perceptually obscuring states that arise due to
pursuing ill will or maliciousness.' Accordingly, the _Nissāraṇīya Sutta_
can be translated as follows:

- _kāmapaccayā uppajjanti āsavā_: perceptually obscuring states that
arise due to pursuing sensuous pleasure

- _vyāpādapaccayā uppajjanti āsavā_: perceptually obscuring states that
arise due to ill will

- _vihesāpaccayā uppajjanti āsavā_: perceptually obscuring states that
arise due to maliciousness

- _rūpapaccayā uppajjanti āsavā_: perceptually obscuring states that
arise due to pursuing refined material states of awareness

- _sakkāyapaccayā uppajjanti āsavā_: perceptually obscuring states that
arise due to pursuing personal identity.

===== Potaliya Sutta: paccayā uppajjanti āsavā

____
The _Potaliya Sutta_ (M.1.361) is another sutta where the connective is
_paccayā uppajjanti_. It says that 'whereas vexatious and anguishing
perceptually obscuring states would arise due to killing, there are no
vexatious and anguishing perceptually obscuring states in abstaining from it.'

_ye ca pāṇātipātapaccayā uppajjeyyuṃ āsavā vighātapariḷāhā
pāṇātipātā paṭiviratassa evaṃsa te āsavā vighātapariḷāhā na
honti_
____

The same is said of stealing, lying, malicious speech, rapacious greed
(_giddhilobho_), spiteful scolding (_nindāroso_), angry despair
(_kodhūpāyāso_) and arrogance (_atimāno_). Here the words 'pursuing' is
again redundant. To kill is to pursue killing. To be arrogant is to pursue
arrogance.

===== Ārabhati Sutta: ārambhajā āsavā

The _Ārabhati Sutta_ (A.3.165) says _āsavas_ are 'born of.' For example, if
someone kills and is conscience-stricken, he should be advised that
perceptually obscuring states born of killing are found in him (_ārambhajā
āsavā saṃvijjanti_), and perceptually obscuring states born of an uneasy
conscience are developing (_vippaṭisārajā āsavā pavaḍḍhanti_). But to
say that _āsavas_ are 'born of' certain conditions is the same as saying they
are 'due to' those conditions, which is our preferred phrasing.

===== How pursuit leads to āsavas

The way that pursuit leads to _āsavas_ can be seen throughout the scriptures.
For example:

[quote, S.5.105]
____
There is the quality of loveliness. Much improper contemplation in that
regard is a condition that nourishes both the arising of unarisen sensuous
hankering, and the increase and expansion of arisen sensuous hankering.

_Atthi bhikkhave subhanimittaṃ. Tattha ayoniso manasikārabahulīkāro
ayamāhāro anuppannassa vā kāmacchandassa uppādāya uppannassa vā
kāmacchandassa bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya._
____

[quote, M.1.7]
____
And what are the issues that should not be contemplated that he contemplates?

_Katame ca bhikkhave dhammā na manasikaraṇīyā ye dhamme manasikaroti?_

(...) Whatever issues that, when he contemplates them:

(...) unarisen perceptual obscuration due to pursuing sensuous pleasure arises,
and arisen perceptual obscuration due to pursuing sensuous pleasure increases

_anuppanno vā kāmāsavo uppajjati uppanno vā kāmāsavo pavaḍḍhati_

(...) unarisen perceptual obscuration due to pursuing individual existence
arises, and arisen perceptual obscuration due to pursuing individual existence
increases

_anuppanno vā bhavāsavo uppajjati uppanno vā bhavāsavo pavaḍḍhati_

(...) unarisen perceptual obscuration due to uninsightfulness into reality
arises, and arisen perceptual obscuration due to uninsightfulness into reality
increases.

_anuppanno vā avijjāsavo uppajjati uppanno vā avijjāsavo pavaḍḍhati._
____

[quote, M.1.9]
____
In this regard a bhikkhu, properly reflecting, abides with the faculty of
sight restrained through restraint [of attraction and repulsion, through
mindfulness]. The vexatious and anguishing perceptually obscuring states that
would arise if he were to abide with the faculty of sight unrestrained through
unrestraint [of attraction and repulsion, through mindfulness] do not arise for
him when he abides with the faculty of sight restrained through restraint [of
attraction and repulsion, through mindfulness].

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu paṭisaṅkhā yoniso cakkhundriyasaṃvarasaṃvuto
viharati. Yaṃ hi'ssa bhikkhave cakkhundriyasaṃvaraṃ asaṃvutassa
viharato uppajjeyyuṃ āsavā vighātapariḷāhā
cakkhundriyasaṃvarasaṃvutassa viharato evaṃsa te āsavā
vighātapariḷāhā na honti._
____

===== Sāsavo: 'associated with perceptually obscuring states'

____
Sometimes the scriptures use the term _sāsavo_, which we render as 'associated
with perceptually obscuring states.' For example, the _Sāsava Sutta_ (A.5.242)
says the factors of the wrong tenfold path are 'associated with perceptually
obscuring states.'

_micchādiṭṭhi... micchāvimutti. Ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave sāsavo dhammo_

Whereas right factors are 'free of perceptually obscuring states'

_sammādiṭṭhi... sammāvimutti. Ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave anāsavo dhammo ti_
____

The _Sāsavadhamma Sutta_ (A.5.275) defines the issue in terms of acts, not
path factors. It says that although unrighteous acts, like killing, are
'associated with perceptually obscuring states' (_sāsavo dhammo_) righteous
acts, like refraining from killing, are not (_anāsavo dhammo_).

Here, unrighteous acts include stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, malicious
speech, harsh speech, frivolous speech, greed (_abhijjhā_), ill will
(_vyāpādo_), and wrong view [of reality] (_micchādiṭṭhi_).

===== Sabbāsava Sutta: examples of āsavas

We will now give specific examples of āsavas. The _Sabbāsava Sutta_ (M.1.9)
lists the first three ties to individual existence (_saṃyojanāni_):

____
the view of personal identity _

_sakkāyadiṭṭhi_

doubt [about the significance of the teaching]

_vicikicchā_

adherence to observances and practices

_sīlabbataparāmāso_

It says when the noble disciple reflects on the four noble truths these ties to
individual existence are abandoned, and calls them 'perceptually obscuring
states to be abandoned by seeing' (i.e. by seeing the four noble truths).

_sakkāyadiṭṭhi vicikicchā sīlabbataparāmāso. Ime vuccanti bhikkhave
āsavā dassanā pahātabbā._
____

These three ties are therefore _āsavas_, perceptually obscuring states.

===== Chabbisodhana Sutta: examples of āsavas

The _Chabbisodhana Sutta_ (M.3.32) says an arahant may be asked in what way he
knows and sees with regard to the six senses and their objects, that through
being without grasping his mind is liberated [from perceptually obscuring
states] (_imesu chasu ajjhattikabāhiresu āyatanesu anupādāya āsavehi
cittaṃ vimuttan ti_).

He would reply that through the destruction, fading away, ending, giving up,
and relinquishment (_khayā virāgā nirodhā cāgā paṭinissaggā_) of

- fondness (_chando_),

- attachment (_rāgo_),

- spiritually fettering delight (_nandi_),

- craving (_taṇhā_),

- clinging and grasping (_upayupādānā_),

- obstinate adherence, stubborn attachment, and identification (_cetaso
adhiṭṭhānābhinivesānusayā_)

regarding the visual sense, visible objects, etc (_cakkhusmiṃ āvuso rūpe
cakkhuviññāṇe cakkhuviññāṇaviññātabbesu dhammesu_) he knows that
his mind is liberated [from perceptually obscuring states] (_vimuttaṃ me
cittan ti pajānāmi_).

Thus fondness, attachment etc are _āsavas_, perceptually obscuring states.

===== Dutiya Bhikkhu Sutta: examples of āsavas

The Dutiya Bhikkhu Sutta (S.5.8) equates destruction of perceptually obscuring
states to the elimination of _rāga, dosa,_ and _moha_:

____
The elimination of attachment, hatred, and undiscernment of reality: the
destruction of perceptually obscuring states is spoken of in that way.

_rāgavinayo dosavinayo mohavinayo ti āsavānaṃ khayo tena vuccatī ti_
____

Thus _rāga, dosa,_ and _moha_ are _āsavas_, perceptually obscuring states.

===== Sabbāsava and Kuṇḍaliya Suttas: examples of āsavas

[quote, M.1.9]
____
Some examples of _āsavas_ can be derived from comparison of texts. For
example, the _Sabbāsava Sutta_ says 'vexatious and anguishing _āsavas_ would
arise if one were to abide with an uncontrolled faculty of sight.

_cakkhundriyasaṃvaraṃ asaṃvutassa viharato uppajjeyyuṃ āsavā
vighātapariḷāhā._
____

The _Kuṇḍaliya Sutta_ (S.5.73) explains what those _āsavas_ are. It says
if there is restraint of the sense faculties [from attraction and repulsion,
through mindfulness] (_indriyasaṃvaro_) one does not long for
(_nābhijjhati_) or get excited by (_nābhihaṃsati_) or become attached to
(_na rāgaṃ janeti_) delightful objects, nor become disconcerted by (_na
maṅku hoti_), daunted (_apatitthinacitto_), dejected (_adīnamanaso_) or
unbenevolent (_avyāpannacetaso_) regarding objectionable objects.

Longing, excitement, and attachment are therefore _āsavas_, perceptually
obscuring states. And so are disconcertedness, dauntedness, dejectedness, and
ill will ('unbenevolence').

===== Devadattavipatti and Dutiyalokadhamma Suttas: examples of āsavas

The _Devadattavipatti Sutta_ (A.4.161) says a bhikkhu should abide continuously
mastering (_abhibhuyya abhibhuyya vihareyya_) the eight worldly conditions
(acquisition, loss, prestige, imprestige etc), otherwise vexatious and
anguishing _āsavas_ will arise (_uppajjeyyuṃ āsavā vighātapariḷāhā_).

The _Dutiyalokadhamma Sutta_ (A.4.157) explains what those _āsavas_ are. It
says that instead of reflecting on the nature of the eight worldly conditions
(_so ca kho anicco dukkho vipariṇāmadhammo ti_), the ignorant Everyman
welcomes (_anurujjhati_) what he likes and rejects (_paṭivirujjhati_) what he
dislikes.

Therefore welcoming and rejecting are _āsavas_, perceptually obscuring states.

===== Sampasādaniya Sutta: examples of āsavas

The _Sampasādaniya Sutta_ (D.3.112) says the nine psychic powers, for example
multiplying one's body, are associated with perceptually obscuring states and
with attachment (_iddhi yā sāsavā saupadhikā_). The association of
_sāsavā_ and _saupadhikā_ suggests the two words are associated in meaning,
and that attachment (_upadhi_) is therefore an _āsava_, a perceptually
obscuring state.

===== Jatukaṇṇī Sutta: examples of āsavas

The _Jatukaṇṇī Sutta_ says:

[quote, Sn.v.1100]
____
For one completely free of greed for denomination-and-bodily-form, brahman,
there are no _āsavas_ by reason of which he would go into the power of death.

_Sabbaso nāmarūpasmiṃ vītagedhassa brāhmaṇa +
Āsavāssa na vijjanti yehi maccuvasaṃ vaje ti._
____

Greed (_gedha_) is therefore an _āsava_, a perceptually obscuring state.

===== Mahācattārīsaka Sutta: examples of āsavas

The _Mahācattārīsaka Sutta_ (M.3.72) says the eightfold path is twofold: one
aspect is 'associated with perceptually obscuring states, that is meritorious
and results in attachment' (_sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko_), the other
aspect is not (_ariyo anāsavo_). The meaning _āsava_ here is to be found in
the word _upadhivepakkā_, 'result in attachment.'

If _āsavas_ 'result in attachment,' then they are represented by _taṇhā_
because 'when there is _taṇhā_, _upadhi_ arises' (_taṇhāya sati upadhi
hoti_ S.2.108). Therefore, as we have already noted above, _taṇhā_ is an
_āsava_, a perceptually obscuring state.

===== Āsavakkhaya Sutta: examples of āsavas

The _Āsavakkhaya Sutta_ says:

[quote, S.5.434]
____
'Bhikkhus, I declare that the destruction of the _āsavas_ is for one who knows
and sees, not for one who does not know and see. Knowing and seeing what are
the _āsavas_ destroyed?

_Jānato ahaṃ bhikkhave passato āsavānaṃ khayaṃ vadāmi no ajānato no
apassato. Kiñca bhikkhave jānato kiṃpassato āsavānaṃ khayo hoti_

This is suffering: knowing and seeing this [according to reality] the _āsavas_
are destroyed.

_idaṃ dukkhan ti bhikkhave jānato passato āsavānaṃ khayo hoti_

'This is the origin of suffering': knowing and seeing this [according to
reality] the _āsavas_ are destroyed.

_ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo ti jānato passato āsavānaṃ khayo hoti_

'This is the ending of suffering': knowing and seeing this [according to
reality] the _āsavas_ are destroyed.

_ayaṃ dukkhanirodhoti jānato passato āsavānaṃ khayo hoti_

'This is the practice leading to the ending of suffering': knowing and seeing
this [according to reality] the _āsavas_ are destroyed.

_ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ti jānato passato āsavānaṃ khayo
hoti._
____

But knowing and seeing the four noble truths involves the ending of the second
noble truth, which must therefore be the _āsavas_ that are destroyed.
Therefore the elements of the second noble truth are _āsavas._

The full formula of the second noble truth is:

____
It is this craving that leads to renewed states of individual existence,
accompanied by spiritually fettering delight and attachment, taking delight in
this and that, namely craving for sensuous pleasure, craving for states of
individual existence, and craving for the cessation of states of individual
existence.

_yāyaṃ taṇhā ponobhavikā nandirāgasahagatā tatra tatrābhinandinī
seyyathīdaṃ kāmataṇhā bhavataṇhā vibhavataṇhā_
____

This formula centres on three elements: _taṇhā, nandi,_ and _rāga._
Therefore, as we have already noted, these three are _āsavas_, perceptually
obscuring states.

===== Freeing oneself of āsavas: Dutiyahāliddikāni Sutta

Many suttas explain how to free oneself of the _āsavas_ using the word
_vimutti_, which means 'liberation from the _āsavas_.' For example, the
_Dutiyahāliddikāni Sutta_ (S.3.13) says _vimutti_ comes from the destruction
or relinquishment of nine _āsavas_:

[quote, S.3.13]
____
Through the destruction, fading away, ending, giving up, and relinquishment of
fondness, attachment, spiritually fettering delight, craving, clinging,
grasping, obstinate adherence, stubborn attachment, and identification one's
mind is said to be liberated [from perceptually obscuring states]

_yo chando yo rāgo yā nandi yā taṇhā ye upayupādānā cetaso
adhiṭṭhānābhinivesānusayā tesaṃ khayā virāgā nirodhā cāgā
paṭinissaggā... cittaṃ suvimuttan ti vuccati._
____

===== Freeing oneself of āsavas: Santatara Sutta

The _Santatara Sutta_ (It.62) says one is liberated from the _āsavas_ by
attaining the ending of perception and sense impression
(_saññāvedayitanirodhadhātu_) which in this quote is called simply
_nirodha_:

[quote, It.62]
____
Those who profoundly understand the refined material states of awareness and
are not stuck in the immaterial states of awareness, with the ending [of
originated phenomena], they are liberated [from perceptually obscuring states].

_ye ca rūpe pariññāya arūpesu asaṇṭhitā +
nirodhe ye vimuccanti._
____

===== Freeing oneself of āsavas: Pārileyyaka Sutta

The _Pārileyyaka Sutta_ says the _āsavas_ are immediately destroyed when one
sees that the components of one's identity are unlasting, originated, and
dependently arisen:

[quote, S.3.96]
____
The ignorant Everyman considers bodily form to be the [absolute] Selfhood

_rūpaṃ attato samanupassati_

(...) That considering is an originated phenomenon

_yā kho pana sā bhikkhave samanupassanā saṅkhāro so_

(...) What is the basis, origin, object of genesis and production of that
originated phenomenon?

_So pana saṅkhāro kinnidāno kiṃsamudayo kiñjātiko kimpabhavoti_

(...) When the ignorant Everyman is affected by sense impression born of
sensation and uninsightfulness into reality, craving arises.

_avijjāsamphassajena bhikkhave vedayitena phuṭṭhassa assutavato
puthujjanassa uppannā taṇhā_

(...) That originated phenomenon is born from that

_tatojo so saṅkhāro_

(...) That originated phenomenon, that craving, that sense impression, that
sensation, that uninsightfulness into reality is unlasting, originated,
dependently arisen.

_sopi kho saṅkhāro... taṇhā... vedanā... phasso... avijjā aniccā
saṅkhatā paṭiccasamuppannā_

(...) When one knows and sees this, there is the immediate destruction of
perceptually obscuring states

_anantarā āsavānaṃ khayo hoti._
____

===== Freeing oneself of āsavas: Sabbāsava Sutta

Given the wide-ranging nature of perceptually obscuring states it is no wonder
that they must be overcome by a range of different methods. This is the subject
of the _Sabbāsava Sutta_, which says perceptually obscuring states are
abandoned in seven ways:

1. Contemplating issues that should be contemplated and not contemplating
issues that should not be contemplated
+
****
_(Sutavā ariyasāvako) ye dhammā na manasikaraṇīyā te dhamme na
manasikaroti ye dhammā manasikaraṇīyā te dhamme manasikaroti._
****

2. Abiding with the faculty of sight... faculty of mental cognisance restrained
through restraint [of attraction and repulsion, through mindfulness].
+
****
_bhikkhu paṭisaṅkhā yoniso cakkhundriyasaṃvarasaṃvuto...
manindriyasaṃvarasaṃvuto viharati_
****

3. Using the robe, almsfood, abode, therapeutic requisites, properly reflecting.
+
****
_bhikkhu paṭisaṅkhā yoniso cīvaraṃ...
gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāraṃ paṭisevati_
****

4. Enduring cold, heat... Enduring bodily sense impressions that are
unpleasant, acute, sharp, piercing, displeasing, objectionable, and
life-threatening.
+
****
_bhikkhu paṭisaṅkhā yoniso khamo hoti... uppannānaṃ sārīrikānaṃ
vedanānaṃ dukkhānaṃ tibbānaṃ kharānaṃ kaṭukānaṃ asātānaṃ
amanāpānaṃ pāṇaharānaṃ adhivāsakajātiko hoti._
****

5. Avoiding wild elephants and horses... and unsuitable seats, unsuitable alms
resorts, and unvirtuous friends that would make one's knowledgeable companions
in the religious life suspect one of unvirtuous ways of conduct
+
****
_bhikkhu paṭisaṅkhā yoniso caṇḍaṃ hatthiṃ parivajjeti...

****

6. Not tolerating arisen sensuous, unbenevolent or malicious thoughts.
+
****
_bhikkhu paṭisaṅkhā yoniso uppannaṃ kāmavitakkaṃ...
vyāpādavitakkaṃ... vihiṃsāvitakkaṃ nādhivāseti_
****

7. Developing the enlightenment factor of mindfulness... the enlightenment
factor of detached awareness.

_bhikkhu paṭisaṅkhā yoniso satisambojjhaṅgaṃ... upekkhā
sambojjhaṅgaṃ bhāveti_ (M.1.7).

===== Destruction of āsavas starts at stream-entry

Although _āsavakkhaya_ is prominently associated with arahantship, _āsavas_
are in fact destroyed from stream-entry onwards. The three types of individuals
who are at least stream-enterers but not arahants are called _kāyasakkhī,
diṭṭhappatto,_ and _saddhāvimutto._ The _Kīṭāgiri Sutta_ (M.1.438)
says that for each of these individuals some of his perceptually obscuring
states are destroyed (_ekacce āsavā parikkhīṇā honti_). But before
stream-entry, no perceptually obscuring states are destroyed (_āsavā
aparikkhīṇā honti_, M.1.479). We will show below that these _āsavas_ are
otherwise known as _saṃyojanāni_ i.e. ties to individual existence.

===== Destruction of āsavas: gradual process

Although many suttas say the _āsavas_ are destroyed just before arahantship,
the _Uposatha Sutta_ (S.3.155) says destroying the _āsavas_ is a more gradual
process. The sutta compares the wearing away of _āsavas_ to the wearing away
of an adze handle. It says when a carpenter looks at the handle of his adze, he
sees the impressions of his fingers and his thumb, but he does not know how
much of the handle wore away that day, or how much on previous days. He only
knows that when the handle is worn away, that it has worn away.

Likewise, when a bhikkhu abides devoted to spiritual development, no such
knowledge occurs to him that so much of his _āsavas_ were destroyed that day,
or so much on previous days, yet when they are destroyed, the knowledge occurs
to him that they have been destroyed (_ettakaṃ vata me ajja āsavānaṃ
khīṇaṃ ettakaṃ hiyyo ettakaṃ pare ti. Atha khvassa khīṇe
khīṇaṃtveva ñāṇaṃ hoti_). According to this, destroying the
_āsavas_ is a gradual, barely perceptible process.

===== Pañca nīvaraṇā: not āsavas

The _Upakkilesa Sutta_ says that to overcome the _āsavas_ one must first
suppress the _pañca nīvaraṇā_:

[quote, A.3.16-17]
____
When one's mind is free of these five defilements, it is pliable and workable
and radiant, not brittle, but is properly collected for the destruction of
perceptually obscuring states.

_Yato ca kho bhikkhave cittaṃ imehi pañcahi upakkilesehi vippamuttaṃ hoti
taṃ hoti cittaṃ mudu ca kammaniyañca pabhassarañca na ca pabhaṅgu
sammāsamādhīyati āsavānaṃ khayāya._
____

This implies that the _pañca nīvaraṇā_ are different from _āsavas_.

===== Pañca nīvaraṇā: are practically āsavas

But the _nīvaraṇas_ and _āsavas_ have much in common, and although
differentiating them is technically justifed, it is problematic to do so,
because of their similarlty. For example:

1. Both are defiling and weakening of penetrative discernment:
+
[quote, M.1.250]
____
Him I call undiscerning of reality, Aggivessana, who has not abandoned
perceptually obscuring states that are defiling... For it is through the
non-abandonment of perceptually obscuring states that one is undiscerning of
reality.

_Yassa kassaci aggivessana ye āsavā saṅkilesikā... appahīnā tamahaṃ
sammūḷho ti vadāmi. Āsavānaṃ hi aggivessana appahānā sammūḷho
hoti._
____
+
[quote, S.5.95]
____
Sensuous hankering (and each of the _nīvaraṇas_) is a spiritual obstruction,
a spiritual hindrance, a spiritual defilement, a weakener of penetrative
discernment.

_kāmacchando āvaraṇo nīvaraṇo cetaso upakkileso paññāya
dubbalīkaraṇo._
____

2. Both _nīvaraṇas_ and _āsavas_ are productive of _avijjā_:
+
[quote, M.1.46-56]
____
With the origination of perceptual obscuration comes the origination of
uninsightfulness into reality

_āsavasamudayā avijjāsamudayo._
____
+
[quote, A.5.116]
____
What is the condition that nourishes uninsightfulness into reality? The five
hindrances, one should reply._

_ko cāhāro avijjāya? Pañca nīvaraṇā tissa vacanīyaṃ._
____

3. In our analysis above, certain factors found to be _āsavas_ are also
_nīvaraṇas_. For example, the first of the _nīvaraṇas_ is _kāmacchanda_;
and we have shown above that _chanda_ is an _āsava_. The fifth of the
_nīvaraṇas_ is _vicikicchā_, which we have shown above is also an _āsava_.

4. The other three _nīvaraṇas_ are linked to _āsava_ via _vimutta_. We have
shown in the Vimutta section that _vimutta_ means 'liberated from _āsavas_.'
The third and fourth of the _nīvaraṇas_ are _thīnamiddhaṃ_ and _uddhacca
kukkucca_. These are treated like _āsavas_ in this quote:
+
[quote, S.5.76-7]
____
My mind is [temporarily] liberated [from perceptually obscuring states]. I have
abolished lethargy and torpor and thoroughly dispelled restlessness and
anxiety. My energy is aroused. I pay attention as a matter of vital concern,
not sluggishly.

_cittañca me suvimuttaṃ thīnamiddhañca me susamūhataṃ. Uddhacca
kukkuccañca me suppaṭivinītaṃ. Āraddhañca me viriyaṃ aṭṭhikatvā
manasikaromi no ca līnan ti._
____
+
The second _nīvaraṇa_ is ill will, and this is shown to be an _āsava_ via
_cetovimutta_:
+
[quote, D.3.248]
____
If the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill is developed and cultivated, it is impossible, out
of the question, that ill will would plague your mind.

_Aṭṭhānametaṃ āvuso anavakāso yaṃ mettāya cetovimuttiyā
bhāvitāya bahulīkatāya... atha ca panassa vyāpādo cittaṃ pariyādāya
ṭhassatī ti._
____

===== Temporary and unshakeable liberation from _āsava_

That _āsavas_ once destroyed do not return is proven by the stream-enterer's
situation. Some of his _āsavas_ are destroyed (_ekacce āsavā parikkhīṇā
honti_ M.1.438) and the rest will certainly follow because he does not take an
eighth [human] existence even if very negligently applied [to the practice]
(_kiñcāpi te honti bhusaṃ pamattā na te bhavaṃ aṭṭhamamādiyanti_).
This, therefore, is a feature of some _āsavas_: once destroyed, they do not
return, even in succeeding lives.

But other _āsavas_ are liable to return. This is implied in these two quotes,
because _cetovimutti_ means liberation from the _āsavas_:

[quote, S.4.297]
____
To whatever extent there are unlimited liberations from perceptually
obscuring states, the unshakeable liberation [from perceptually obscuring
states] is declared the chief among them.

_yāvatā kho bhante appamāṇā cetovimuttiyo akuppā tāsaṃ cetovimutti
aggamakkhāyati._
____

If some liberations from perceptually obscuring states are 'unshakeable,' then
others are shakeable i.e. some _āsavas_ are liable to return.

[quote, S.1.120]
____
Then Venerable Godhika, abiding diligently, vigorously, and resolutely
applied [to the practice] attained temporary liberation [from perceptually
obscuring states]. But then Venerable Godhika fell away from that temporary
liberation [from perceptually obscuring states].

_Atha kho āyasmā godhiko appamatto ātāpī pahitatto viharanto sāmayikaṃ
cetovimuttiṃ phusi. Atha kho āyasmā godhiko tāya sāmayikāya
cetovimuttiyā parihāyi._
____

So, some _āsavas_ are liable to return. These quotes therefore show that
liberation from the _āsavas_ is not necessarily unshakeable. The same point is
seen in the _Sabbāsava Sutta_, which describes various modes of behaviour in
which _āsavas_ might arise, and if these modes of behaviour are avoided, then
those _āsavas_ do not exist. For example:

[quote, M.1.11]
____
In this regard a bhikkhu, properly reflecting, does not tolerate an arisen
sensuous thought. He abandons it, dispels it, puts an end to it, eradicates it.

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu paṭisaṅkhā yoniso uppannaṃ kāmavitakkaṃ
nādhivāseti pajahati vinodeti vyantīkaroti. Anabhāvaṃ gameti._

(...) The vexatious and anguishing _āsavas_ that would arise if he were not to
dispel these things do not arise for him when he dispels them.

_Yaṃ hissa bhikkhave avinodayato uppajjeyyuṃ āsavā vighātapariḷāhā.
Vinodayato evaṃsa te āsavā vighātapariḷāhā na honti._
____

According to this, _āsavas_ may or may not arise according to the standard of
one's practice. So even if they disappear, they may later reappear.

This contradiction of reappearing versus non-reappearing _āsavas_ stems from
the two categories of āsavas mentioned above, firstly, the broad, undefined
category which practically includes the _pañca nīvaraṇā_, and secondly,
the narrow, well-defined category which does not. _Āsavas_ that are liable to
reappear belong to the former category, whereas it seems that _āsavas_ which
are removed permanently are otherwise called _saṃyojanāni,_ i.e. the ties to
individual existence. We have already seen that the first three such ties are
specifically called _āsavas_. These and the other seven ties to individual
existence fall into two groups, as follows:

[quote, S.5.61-62]
____

===== Āsavas and rebirth

That _āsavas_ play an important role in rebirth is evident in these quotes:

1. Perceptually obscuring states that are defiling, and which lead to renewed
states of individual existence, suffering, unpleasant karmic consequences, and
future birth, old age, and death;
+
****
_ye āsavā saṅkilesikā ponobhavikā sadarā dukkhavipākā āyatiṃ
jātijarāmaraṇīyā_ (M.1.250).
****

2. 'Those perceptually obscuring states through which I might have become a
deva... a heavenly musician... a deity... a human being have been abandoned by
me, chopped down at the root, completely and irreversibly destroyed.'
+
****
_Yesaṃ kho ahaṃ brāhmaṇa āsavānaṃ appahīṇattā devo...
gandhabbo... yakkho... manusso bhaveyyaṃ te me āsavā pahīṇā
ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā anabhāvakatā āyatiṃ anuppādadhammā_
(A.2.38).
****

3. What is the variety in perceptually obscuring states?
+
****
_Katamā ca bhikkhave āsavānaṃ vemattatā_
****

[quote, A.3.414]
____
(...) There are perceptually obscuring states leading to hell, to the animal
realm, to the realm of ghosts, to the human realm, and to the heavenly realms.

_atthi bhikkhave āsavā nirayagāminiyā... tiracchānayonigāminiyā...
pettivisayagāminiyā... manussalokagāminiyā... devalokagāminiyā... ayaṃ
vuccati bhikkhave āsavānaṃ vemattatā._
____

===== Āsavas and unpleasant karmic consequences

_Āsavas_ lead to renewed states of individual existence, suffering, unpleasant
karmic consequences (_āsavā saṅkilesikā ponobhavikā sadarā
dukkhavipākā_ M.1.250). This can be illustrated with the following quotes
concerning _taṇhā_, which we have said above is an _āsava_.

[quote, M.1.507-8]
____
The more such beings pursue sensuous pleasure the more their craving for
sensuous pleasure increases and the more they are tormented by sensuous passion

_Yathā yathā kho māgandiya sattā kāmesu avītarāgā kāmataṇhāhi
khajjamānā kāmapariḷāhena pariḍayhamānā kāme paṭisevanti tathā
tathā tesaṃ sattānaṃ kāmataṇhā ceva pavaḍḍhati kāmapariḷāhena
ca pariḍayhanti.._
____

[quote, M.3.287]
____
For one who abides attached, tethered [to individual existence],
undiscerning of reality, contemplating sweetness, the five grasped aggregates
are heaped up in the future. Craving that leads to renewed states of individual
existence, accompanied by spiritually fettering delight and attachment, taking
delight in this and that, grows.

_Tassa sārattassa saṃyuttassa sammūḷhassa assādānupassino viharato
āyatiṃ pañcupādānakkhandhā upacayaṃ gacchanti. Taṇhā cassa
ponobhavikā nandirāgasahagatā tatra tatrābhinandinī sā cassa
pavaḍḍhati._

... One's physical and psychological sufferings, torments, and anguishes
increase.

_Tassa kāyikāpi darathā pavaḍḍhanti cetasikāpi darathā pavaḍḍhanti
kayikāpi santāpā pavaḍḍhanti cetasikāpi santāpā pavaḍḍhanti
kāyikāpi pariḷāhā pavaḍḍhanti cetasikāpi pariḷāhā

In this regard a bhikkhu, properly reflecting, endures cold, heat, hunger, and

ill-spoken, unwelcome words and arisen bodily sense impressions that are

===== Existential nourishment

The four kinds of _āhārā_ are for 'the maintenance of beings that have been
brought into existence and for the assistance of those about to arise [into new
existence]' (_bhūtānaṃ vā sattānaṃ ṭhitiyā sambhavesīnaṃ vā
anuggahāya_). Therefore we call them the four kinds of existential nourishment.

established in him.

=== Itibhavābhava

==== Renderings

- _itibhavābhava_: honour and renown

==== Introduction

===== Rendering Itibhavābhava

_Itibhavābhava_ is usually rendered in terms of 'being' or 'becoming' or
'existence.' For example:

[quote, M.2.238]
____
Bodhi: We do not think thus about the Blessed One: 'The recluse Gotama teaches
the Dhamma... for the sake of some better state of being.'

_itibhavābhavahetu vā samaṇo gotamo dhammaṃ desetī ti._
____

[quote, A.1.147]
____
Bodhi: I did not go forth from the household life into homelessness... for the
sake of becoming this or that.

_na itibhavābhavahetu agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajito._
____

[quote, Sn.v.6]
____
Norman: That bhikkhu... [who] has gone beyond the state of [being reborn in]
such-and-such an existence.

_itibhavābhavatañca vītivatto._
____

===== Saṅgīti Sutta: aspiration for divine rebirth

The idea that bhikkhus might live the religious life for the purpose of some
future happy existence is supported by the _Saṅgīti Sutta_ (D.3.239), which
says:

[quote, D.3.239]
____
A bhikkhu lives the religious life aspiring to rebirth amongst some group of
devas, thinking that through his observances, practices, austerities, and
religious life he will become a greater or lesser deva.

_Puna ca paraṃ āvuso bhikkhu aññataraṃ devanikāyaṃ paṇidhāya
brahmacariyaṃ carati imināhaṃ sīlena vā vatena vā tapena vā
brahmacariyena vā devo vā bhavissāmī devaññataro vā ti._
____

But _itibhavābhava_ more likely involves desire for things of the present
life, specifically the desire for honour and renown, because the scriptures
unvaryingly place (1) _itibhavābhava_ and (2) honour and renown in
corresponding positions beside unvirtuous desires for robe material, almsfood,
and abodes.

===== Itibhavābhava: honour and renown

Although _itibhavābhava_ occurs in the scriptures 48 times, in only 3 cases is
there any meaningful context, which are as follows:

_Taṇhā Sutta_

[quote, A.2.248]
____
Craving arises in a bhikkhu on account of robe material, almsfood, abodes, and
_itibhavābhava_.

_Cīvarahetu... Piṇḍapātahetu... Senāsanahetu... +
Itibhavābhavahetu vā bhikkhuno taṇhā uppajjamānā uppajjati._
____

_Ādhipateyya Sutta_

[quote, A.1.147]
____
It was not for the sake of robe material that I went forth from the household
life into the ascetic life, nor almsfood, nor abodes, nor _itibhavābhava_.

_na kho panā'haṃ cīvarahetu... piṇḍapātahetu... senāsanahetu...
itibhavābhavahetu agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajito._
____

_Kinti Sutta_

[quote, M.2.238]
____
We do not think this about the Blessed One: 'The ascetic Gotama explains his
teaching for the sake of robe material, almsfood, abodes, or _itibhavābhava_.

_Na kho no bhante bhagavati evaṃ hoti cīvarahetu vā... piṇḍapātahetu
vā... senāsanahetu vā... itibhavābhavahetu vā samaṇo gotamo dhammaṃ
deseti tī._
____

Thus the unvirtuous search for _itibhavābhava_ is always associated with
unvirtuous searches for robe material, almsfood, and abodes.

===== Itibhavābhava corresponds to honour and renown

Unvirtuous searches for gains (e.g. robe material, almsfood, and abodes) are
linked in some suttas to _sakkārasiloka_. For example, the _Mātugāma Sutta_
says a bhikkhu could be more obsessed by gains, honour, and renown than by a
woman:

[quote, S.2.235]
____
Even if a woman when one is alone with her might not obsess one's mind, still
gains, honour, and renown might obsess one's mind.

_na tassa bhikkhave mātugāmo eko ekassa cittaṃ pariyādāya tiṭṭhati
yassa lābhasakkārasiloko cittaṃ pariyādāya tiṭṭhati_
____

The _Mahāsāropama Sutta_ warns:

[quote, M.1.197]
____
This religious life does not have gains, honour, and renown as its true benefit.

_nayidaṃ brahmacariyaṃ lābhasakkārasilokānisaṃsaṃ._
____

If one compares these two searches:

1. searches for robe material, almsfood, abodes, and _itibhavābhava_

2. searches for gains, honour, and renown

Then:

1. robe material, almsfood, and abodes correspond to 'gains'

2. _itibhavābhava_ corresponds to 'honour and renown.'

===== Teaching: Āmisasikkhāpadaṃ

We have seen that the bhikkhus denied that the Buddha explained his teaching
for the sake of robe material, almsfood, abodes, or _itibhavābhava_. Because
other suttas cover the same territory in different terms, they shed light on
_itibhavābhava_. For example, the _Āmisasikkhāpadaṃ_ rule says it is an
offence for bhikkhus to wrongfully say:

[quote, Vin.4.58]
____
Elder bhikkhus instruct the bhikkhunīs for the sake of worldly benefits.

_Āmisahetu therā bhikkhū bhikkhuniyo ovadantī ti._
____

The Word Analysis defines worldly benefits like this:

____
For the sake of worldly benefits means: for the sake of robes, almsfood,
abodes, therapeutic requisites, honour, respect, and veneration.

_Amisahetu ti cīvarahetu piṇḍapātahetu senāsanahetu
gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhārehetu sakkārahetu garukārahetu manatahetu
vandanahetu pujanahetu._
____

Similarly, the _Udāyī Sutta_ says one should explain the teaching to others
with the thought:

[quote, A.3.184]
____
I will speak step-by-step

_Ānupubbīkathaṃ kathessāmīti paresaṃ dhammo desetabbo_

I will speak observing a proper method of exposition

_Pariyāyadassāvī kathaṃ kathessāmīti paresaṃ dhammo desetabbo_

I will speak out of sympathy

_Anuddayataṃ paṭicca kathaṃ kathessāmīti paresaṃ dhammo desetabbo_

I will speak not for the sake of worldly benefits

_Na āmisantaro kathaṃ kathessāmīti paresaṃ dhammo desetabbo_

I will speak without hurting myself or others

_Attānañca parañca anupahacca kathaṃ kathessāmī ti paresaṃ dhammo
desetabbo._
____

Both the _Āmisasikkhāpadaṃ_ rule and the _Udāyī Sutta_ link teaching to
worldly benefits, where worldly benefits is defined in the rule as robes,
almsfood, abodes, therapeutic requisites, honour, respect, and veneration. This
corresponds to the list of advantages that were not reasons for the Buddha
explaining his teaching i.e. robe material, almsfood, abodes, or
_itibhavābhava_. According to these lists, _itibhavābhava_ stands for honour,
respect, and veneration.

=== Imaṃ kāyaṃ

==== Renderings

- _imaṃ kāyaṃ_: this [wretched human] body

==== Introduction

===== Justifying parentheses

1. We call _imaṃ kāyaṃ_ 'this [wretched human] body.' The parenthesis
'wretched' is justified because the dictionaries say _ayaṃ_ and _idaṃ_
often imply sarcasm or contempt:

- _Imaṃ_ has 'a touch of (often sarcastic) characterisation,' says PED (sv
_Ayaṃ_).

- DOP (sv _Idaṃ_) says: 'such, like that (often implying contempt).'

2. The parenthesis 'human' is for stylistic purposes. The same idea is seen in
Pāli, because the suttas sometimes refer to the human body as _mānusaṃ
dehaṃ_ (S.1.27). Thus we take _imaṃ kāyaṃ_ as standing for _imaṃ
[mānusaṃ] kāyaṃ_.

==== Introduction

===== Uju: straight

The adjective _uju_ means either physically or spiritually straight.

===== Uju: spiritual purity

_Uju_ sometimes means spiritual purity, because the _Mahānāma Sutta_
(A.3.285) says that when the noble disciple reflects on the Perfect One, his
mind is not absorbed in _rāga dosa_ or _moha._ At that time his mind 'is made
_uju'_ with the Perfect One as the initiating factor (_ujugatamevassa tasmiṃ
samaye cittaṃ hoti tathāgataṃ ārabbha_ (A.3.285).

_Uju_ here means the disciple's mind is free from _rāga dosa_ and _moha_,
either temporarily or permanently, and _uju_ therefore means 'purified,' and
the disciple is therefore 'spiritually purified.'

===== Ujuka: -ka suffix

The -_ka_ suffix of _uju_ is in accordance with Duroiselle's observation: 'Not
seldom -_ka_ adds nothing whatever to the primary meaning of a word ' (PGPL,
Para 581). DOP agrees (sv _Ujuka_ and _Ka2_).

=== Uddhacca; Uddhata

==== Renderings

- _uddhacca_: restlessness

- _uddhata_: restless

- _uddhacca_: agitation

- _uddhata_: agitated

- _uddhacca_: vanity

- _uddhata_: vain

- _dhammuddhacca_: righteous disquietude

==== Introduction

===== The problem of uddhacca

The problem of _uddhacca_ is illustrated in Bodhi's rendering of _uddhacca_,
both the fourth hindrance and the ninth fetter, as 'restlessness,' and Norman's
rendering both cases as 'conceit' (e.g. Thī.v.167, Th.v.1010, Th.v.760).

Strangely, DOP does not recognise 'conceit' for _uddhacca_ in spite of
accepting 'puffed up' for _uddhata_, and acknowledging that _uddhacca_ is
derived from _uddhata_.

===== The problem with restlessness

The five hindrances are hindrances to samādhi, and non-returners have perfect
samādhi (_samādhismiṃ paripūrakārī hoti_, A.1.232) which implies that
the five hindrances including _uddhacca_ are insignificant in non-returners.
And yet non-returners are still troubled by _uddhacca_ the ninth fetter. So the
two forms of _uddhacca_ must be different, and it is unlikely that the
restlessness of the fourth hindrance is also the ninth fetter.

===== The problem with conceit

But Norman's suggestion is also problematic, because it implies that the
hindrance to first jhāna would remain active until arahantship, when the ninth
tie to individual existence is finally abandoned. Unless conceit can be
temporarily quelled like lust and hatred, first jhāna would only be available
to arahants. So again, _uddhacca_ must have two meanings.

===== Double meanings of uddhata and capala

Part of the confusion is that both _uddhata_ and _capala_ which frequently
occur together, have double meanings, as follows:

Grouping 1:

- _uddhata_: restless

- _capala_: fidgety/fluttery

Grouping 2:

- _uddhata_: vain

- _capala_: puffed up

===== Uddhata and capala: illustrated

The meanings of _uddhacca_ and _capala_ can be illustrated as follows:

1. _uddhata_: restless
+
[quote, S.5.115]
____
When one's mind is restless it is timely to develop the enlightenment
factors of tranquillity, inward collectedness, and detached awareness.

_Yasmiṃ bhikkhave samaye uddhataṃ cittaṃ hoti kālo tasmiṃ samaye
passaddhisambojjhaṅgassa bhāvanāya._
____

2. _capala_: fluttery
+
[quote, Dh.v.33]
____
Like a fletcher straightens an arrow, the wise man straightens up his unsteady,
fluttery mind, which is hard to supervise, hard to restrain.

_Phandanaṃ capalaṃ cittaṃ durakkhaṃ dunnivārayaṃ +
Ujuṃ karoti medhāvī usukāro va tejanaṃ._
____

3. _uddhato_: vain; _capalo_: puffed up
+
[quote, Th.v.1080]
____
A vain, puffed up bhikkhu clothed in rag-robes does not look glorious because
of it. He is like a monkey in a lion-skin.

_Uddhato capalo bhikkhu paṃsukūlena pāruto +
Kapīva sīhacammena na so tenupasobhati._
____

4. _uddhato_: vain; _capalo_: puffed up
+
[quote, Th.v.157]
____
Because of improper contemplation I was addicted to finery. I was vain, puffed
up, and afflicted by lust for sensuous pleasure.

_Ayoniso manasikārā maṇḍanaṃ anuyuñjisaṃ +
Uddhato capalo cāsiṃ kāmarāgena aṭṭito._
____

===== Dutiya Anuruddha Sutta: tranquility and peace are not 'restlessness'

An interesting muddle occurs in the _Dutiya Anuruddha Sutta_ (A.1.282), where
Venerable Anuruddha complained about his slowness in attaining arahantship in
spite of outstanding spiritual qualities. Venerable Sāriputta told him:

[quote, A.1.282]
____
'Anuruddha, when you say "With purified divine vision surpassing that of men, I
survey the thousandfold multi-universe system," that is your self-centredness
(_māna_).

_Yaṃ kho te āvuso anuruddha evaṃ hoti: evāhaṃ dibbena cakkhunā
visuddhena atikkantamānusakena sahassaṃ lokaṃ olokemī ti idante
mānasmiṃ._

(...) 'When you say "My unflagging energy is aroused, unmuddled mindfulness is
established, my body is tranquil and peaceful, my mind is collected and
concentrated," that is your vanity (_uddhacca_).

_Yampi te āvuso anuruddha evaṃ hoti: āraddhaṃ kho pana me viriyaṃ
asallīnaṃ upaṭṭhitā sati apammuṭṭhā passaddho kāyo asāraddho
samāhitaṃ cittaṃ ekaggan ti idante uddhaccasmiṃ_

(...) 'When you say "But for all that my mind is not liberated from perceptually
obscuring states through being without grasping," that is your fretting
(_kukkucca_).

_Yampi te āvuso anuruddha evaṃ hoti atha ca pana me na anupādāya āsavehi
cittaṃ vimuccatī ti idante kukkuccasmiṃ._
____

It makes little sense to say that claiming one's body is tranquil and peaceful
can be explained as restlessness (_uddhacca_), as Bodhi puts it. DOP's
suggestion 'puffed up' is preferable, using 'vanity' as the noun for
'puffed-upness.'

===== Causes of the fourth hindrance

The causes of _uddhacca_, the fourth hindrance, are:

1. Excessive exertion: if a meditator focuses excessively on the practice of
effort, it leads to restlessness (_ekantaṃ paggahanimittaññeva
manasikareyya ṭhānaṃ taṃ cittaṃ uddhaccāya saṃvatteyya_). The
suttas say it is like a goldsmith who, if he blows too much on molten gold will
simply burn it up.

2. No inward collectedness: Just as the goldsmith should sprinkle gold with
water to keep it cool, the meditator should from time to time focus on the
practice of inward collectedness (_kālena kālaṃ samādhinimittaṃ
manasikātabbaṃ_) (A.1.256) or inward peacefulness (_cetaso vūpasamo_)
(S.5.106) because this removes restlessness (_uddhaccassa pahānāya samatho
bhāvetabbo_) (A.3.449).

3. Argumentative speech (_viggāhikakathaṃ_): this leads to overtalkativeness
(_kathābāhullaṃ_). With overtalkativeness comes restlessness
(_kathābāhulle sati uddhaccaṃ_) (A.4.87).

===== Agitation

Occasionally _uddhacca_ means 'agitation', not restlessness. For example, the
Buddha said a bhikkhu should visit families in a humble manner, lest he be
embarrassed if he receives nothing:

[quote, A.4.87]
____
And so, from getting nothing, he becomes embarrassed _

_Itissa alābhena maṅkubhāvo_

(...) Being embarrassed, he becomes agitated

_maṅkubhūtassa uddhaccaṃ_

(...) Being agitated, his sense faculties are unrestrained [from attraction and
repulsion, through mindfulness]

_uddhatassa asaṃvaro._
____

===== Righteous disquietude: dhammuddhacca

One form of _uddhacca_ is called righteous disquietude (_dhammuddhacca_). It
comprises the fourth path to arahantship. The first three paths are:

____
insightfulness preceded by inward calm

_samathapubbaṅgamaṃ vipassanaṃ_

inward calm preceded by insightfulness

_vipassanāpubbaṅgamaṃ samathaṃ_

inward calm together with insightfulness

_samathavipassanaṃ yuganaddhaṃ_
____

The fourth path is described as follows:

[quote, A.2.157]
____
Or a bhikkhu's mind is seized by righteous disquietude

_bhikkhuno dhammuddhaccaviggahītaṃ mānaṃ hoti_

... But there comes a time when his mind becomes settled, calm,
concentrated, and collected.

_so samayo yantaṃ cittaṃ ajjhattaṃyeva santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi
hoti samādhiyati._

... In him the path is born

_tassa maggo sañjāyati._
____

Therefore _dhammuddhacca_ is abandoned at stream-entry when the path is born,
because:

[quote, S.5.348]
____
One possessed of this noble eightfold path, bhante, is called a stream-enterer.

_Yo hi bhante iminā ariyena aṭṭhaṅgikena maggena samannāgato ayaṃ
vuccati sotāpanno._
____

===== Dhammuddhacca: a synonym for saṃvega

_Dhammuddhacca_ is perhaps a synonym for _saṃvega_. It could therefore be
illustrated by this account of practice:

[quote, Th.v.790-1]
____
Seeing sensuous pleasures as [dangerous as] a blazing [grass torch being
carried against the wind], and gold pieces as [dangerous as a sharp] knife, and
life from the time of conception as suffering, and great danger in the
[possibility of the] hells,

_Kāme ādittato disvā jātarūpāni satthato +
Gabbhavokkantito dukkhaṃ nirayesu mahabbhayaṃ._

(...) Recognising this danger, I was filled with an earnest attitude [to the
practice].

_Etamādīnavaṃ ñatvā saṃvegaṃ alabhiṃ tadā_

(...) I was quickened then peaceful. I have accomplished the destruction of
perceptually obscuring states.

_Sohaṃ viddho tadā santo sampatto āsavakkhayaṃ._
____

COMMENT

Norman has said (Elders' Verses note 791) that 'it is possible that _viddha_ is
the equivalent of _vyathita_, the past participle of _vyath_- "shaken." The
context supports us treating it as standing for the past participle of
_saṃvijjati_, to be quickened.

So too, brahman, when one dwells with a mind absorbed in and overcome by
restlessness and anxiety, and does not discern according to reality the
deliverance from the arisen restlessness and anxiety, one does not know or see
either one's own well-being, or that of others, or that of both.

_yasmiṃ samaye uddhaccakukkuccapariyuṭṭhitena cetasā viharati

==== Introduction

===== Parenthesising upadduta: ravaged [by old age and death]

In the following quote we parenthesise '[by old age and death]':

[quote, "Ven. Tāḷapuṭa, Th.v.1133"]
____
The mountains, oceans, rivers, and the earth; the four directions, the
intermediate points, the nadir, and the zenith, are all unlasting. The three
planes of existence are ravaged [by old age and death]. Where having gone,
mind, will you delight happily?

_Nagā samuddā saritā vasundharā disā catasso vidisā adho divā +
Sabbe aniccā tibhavā upaddutā kuhiṃ gato citta sukhaṃ ramissasi._
____

We say 'ravaged [by old age and death]' based on a similar word combination in
Th.v.1093 by the same Tāḷapuṭa, who said there that the body is unlasting
and ravaged by old age and death (_maccujarāyupaddutaṃ_):

[quote, "Ven. Tāḷapuṭa, Th.v.1093"]
____
When will I dwell alone in the woods, free of fear, seeing [according to
reality] that this [wretched human] body is unlasting, a seat of punishment and
illness, ravaged by old age and death? When, oh when, will it be?

_Kadā aniccaṃ vadharoganīḷaṃ kāyaṃ imaṃ maccujarāyupaddutaṃ +
Vipassamāno vītabhayo vihassaṃ eko vane taṃ nu kadā bhavissati._

===== Parenthesising upadduta: ravaged [by old age and death]

In the following quote we parenthesise '[by old age and death]':

[quote, S.4.28-9]
____
All is ravaged [by old age and death]. What is the all that is ravaged [by old
age and death]?_

_Sabbaṃ bhikkhave upaddutaṃ. Kiñca bhikkhave sabbaṃ upaddutaṃ_

(...) The visual sense is ravaged, visible objects are ravaged, advertence to the
visual field is ravaged, visual sensation is ravaged, whatever sense impression
that arises due to visual sensation -- whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral
-- that too is ravaged [by old age and death].

_cakkhuṃ bhikkhave upaddutaṃ rūpā upaddutā cakkhuviññāṇaṃ
upaddutaṃ cakkhusamphasso upadduto yampidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā
uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi
upaddutaṃ._
____

We parenthesise like this for two reasons:

1. Firstly, this sutta is placed in the scriptures in a sequence of similar
suttas, as follows:
+
[quote, S.4.26-9]
____
All is subject to birth... subject to old age... subject to illness... subject
to death... productive of grief... All is ravaged... All is afflicted.

_Sabbaṃ bhikkhave... jātidhammaṃ... jarādhammaṃ... vyādhidhammaṃ...
maraṇadhammaṃ... sokadhammaṃ... upaddutaṃ... upassaṭṭhaṃ._
____

2. Secondly, it is comparable to the _Addabhūta Sutta_ which says:
+
[quote, S.4.21]
____
All is conquered. What is the all that is conquered?_

_Sabbaṃ bhikkhave addhabhūtaṃ. Kiñca bhikkhave sabbaṃ addhabhūtaṃ?_

(...) The visual sense is conquered, visible objects are conquered, etc. .

_Cakkhuṃ bhikkhave addhabhūtaṃ rūpā addhabhūtā_

(...) Conquered by what? Conquered by birth, old age, and death; by grief,
lamentation, physical pain, psychological pain, and vexation, I declare.

_Kena addhabhūtaṃ: addhabhūtaṃ jātiyā jarāmaraṇena sokehi paridevehi
dukkhehi domanassehi upāyāsehi addhabhūtanti vadāmi._
____

We refrain from saying 'All is ravaged [by birth, old age, and death; by grief,
lamentation, physical pain, psychological pain, and vexation]' for three
reasons:

1. Most of the elements are not ravaged by physical pain.

2. To say that 'phenomena are ravaged by birth' is incongruous.

3. It is consonant with Tāḷapuṭa's _maccujarāyupaddutaṃ_ (Th.v.1093).

===== Parenthesising upadduta: ravaged [by death]

In the following quote we parenthesise '[by death]':

[quote, Vin.1.15]
____
Then Yasa, having awoken sooner than usual saw his retinue asleep: one with a
lute in her arm, one with a tabor under her chin, one with a drum under her
arm, one with dishevelled hair, one who was dribbling, and others who were
muttering. One would think it was a charnel ground before one's eyes. Seeing
this, the danger [of sensuous pleasure] became apparent to him. His mind was
established in disillusionment [with sensuous pleasure].

_Atha kho yaso kulaputto paṭigacceva pabujjhitvā addasa sakaṃ parijanaṃ
supantaṃ. Aññissā kacche vīṇaṃ. Aññissā kaṇṭhe mudiṅgaṃ.
Aññissā kacche ālambaraṃ. Aññaṃ vikkesikaṃ aññaṃ vikkhelikaṃ.
Aññā vippalapantiyo. Hatthappattaṃ susānaṃ maññe. Disvānassa
ādīnavo pāturahosi. Nibbidāya cittaṃ saṇṭhāsi._

Then Yasa, the noble young man, uttered the solemn reflection: 'Alas, [all] is
ravaged [by death]. Alas, [all] is afflicted [by death].'

_Atha kho yaso kulaputto udānaṃ udānesi upaddutaṃ vata bho
upassaṭṭhaṃ vata bho ti._
____

Comment:

We say '[all] is ravaged [by death]' for the following reasons:

1. 'All' is consonant with the association elsewhere of _upaddutaṃ_ and
_upassaṭṭhaṃ_ and _sabbaṃ_:
+
[quote, S.4.29]
____
All is ravaged... All is afflicted.

_Sabbaṃ bhikkhave... upaddutaṃ... upassaṭṭhaṃ._
____

2. 'Death' is consonant with the charnel ground.

3. 'Death' is consonant with Tāḷapuṭa's _maccujarāyupaddutaṃ_
(Th.v.1093).

He has been struck down by unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors that are
defiling, and which lead to renewed states of individual existence, suffering,

=== Upadhi

==== Renderings

- _upadhi_: a state of attachment

- _upadhi_: the phenomenon of attachment

- _upadhi_: an object of attachment

- _upadhi_: a worldly object of attachment

==== Introduction

===== Upadhi: four meanings

_Upadhi_ is often divided into two groups. PED, DOP, and Bodhi, for example,
all broadly say it means either possessions, or attachment to possessions,
which Bodhi renders as 'acquisitions' and 'acquisition' respectively. But
_upadhi_ has four meanings:

===== 1) States of attachment, plural

For example:

[quote, S.1.107]
____
'The Buddha, having destroyed all states of attachment'

_sabbūpadhīnaṃ parikkhayā buddho._
____

The usual twofold classification system fails to capture this meaning, because
its plural obliges one to say the Buddha destroyed all his possessions, which
is how Bodhi translates it: 'With the destruction of all acquisitions the
Awakened One sleeps' (Bodhi, S.1.107).

===== 2) The phenomenon of attachment, singular

For example:

[quote, M.2.260]
____
The phenomenon of attachment is the origin of _dukkha_'

_upadhi dukkhassa mūlan ti._
____

Or, more concisely:

[quote, M.2.260]
____
Attachment is the origin of _dukkha_.

_upadhi dukkhassa mūlan ti._
____

But one must be careful about conciseness. It can lead to double meanings, to
confusing state of attachment, object of attachment, and phenomenon of
attachment.

===== 3) Objects of attachment, commonly plural

For example:

[quote, It.69]
____
All objects of attachment are unlasting'

_sabbe upadhī aniccā._
____

===== 4) Worldly objects of attachment

For example:

[quote, M.1.162]
____
Wife, children, men and women slaves, goats, sheep, fowl, pigs, elephants,
cattle, horses, mares, gold, and silver are subject to birth. These worldly
objects of attachment are subject to birth.

_Puttabhariyaṃ bhikkhave jātidhammaṃ dāsidāsaṃ jātidhammaṃ
ajeḷakaṃ jātidhammaṃ kukkuṭasūkaraṃ jātidhammaṃ
hatthigavāssavaḷavaṃ jātidhammaṃ jātarūparajataṃ jātidhammaṃ.
Jātidhammāhete bhikkhave upadhayo._
____

[quote, M.1.435]
____
A bhikkhu secluded from worldly objects of attachment, with the abandonment of
spiritually unwholesome factors and the allayment of all unvirtuous conduct by
way of body... enters and abides in first jhāna.

_upadhivivekā akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ pahānā sabbaso
kāyaduṭṭhullānaṃ paṭipassaddhiyā... paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ
upasampajja viharati._
____

===== Discriminating upadhi's

- When a bhikkhu attains jhāna, he is 'secluded from _upadhi_'
(_upadhivivekā_) i.e. secluded from 'worldly objects of attachment,' not 'all
objects of attachment'. He still has a body.

- When a bhikkhu attains _nibbāna_ he relinquishes all _upadhi_
(_sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo_) i.e. relinquishes 'the whole phenomenon of
attachment,' not 'all attachments' (M.1.436).

irreversibly destroyed, never to arise again in future.

_pahīnā honti ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā anabhāvakatā āyatiṃ

A bhikkhu possessing such [resolve for relinquishment] possesses the supreme
resolve for relinquishment.

_paramena cāgādhiṭṭhānena samannāgato hoti._

For this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble relinquishment, namely the
relinquishment of the whole phenomenon of attachment.

That _upādāna_ is best rendered as grasping not clinging is nowhere clearer
than in the fact that the Buddha 'does not sit while grasping his chin with his
hand' (_na ca pāṇinā hanukaṃ upādiyitvā nisīdati_, M.2.138).

=== Upāyāsa; Āyāsa

==== Renderings

- _upāyāsa_: vexation

- _upāyāsabahula_: easily vexed

- _āyāsa_: vexation

- _āyāsa_: annoyance

==== Introduction

===== The problem of upāyāsa: the dictionaries

The problem of _upāyāsa_ is nicely illustrated in the disagreement between
dictionaries and translators. To find it called 'despair' in a dictionary, one
must return to 1875 when Childer called it 'desperation, despair.' Later
dictionaries call it:

- PED: trouble, turbulence, misery, unrest, disturbance, unsettled condition

- DOP: trouble, unrest, annoyance, irritation.

===== Upāyāsa and Āyāsa

Both Pāli dictionaries treat _āyāsa_ as practically equivalent to
_upāyāsa_.

- PED: trouble, sorrow

- DOP: exertion, trouble, weariness, distress

This is appropriate, because _upāyāsa_ is defined in terms of _āyāsa_:

[quote, M.3.250]
____
What is vexation? It is the annoyance, the vexation, the state of annoyance
in one who has some sort of misfortune or other, who is affected by some sort
of unpleasant event or another. This is called vexation.

_Katamo cāvuso upāyāso: yo kho āvuso aññataraññatarena vyasanena
samannāgatassa aññataraññatarena dukkhadhammena phuṭṭhassa āyāso
upāyāso āyāsitattaṃ upāyāsitattaṃ ayaṃ vuccatāvuso upāyāso._
____

===== Sanskrit equivalent

The Sanskrit-English Dictionary (Monier-Williams) supports the Pāli
dictionaries in rejecting 'despair':

- _Āyasta_: pained, distressed, vexed, angry

- _Āyāsa_: fatigue, weariness.

===== The problem of upāyāsa: the translators

But strikingly, almost all translators persist in calling it despair. Only
since 2012 has Bodhi rejected the word.

- Ñāṇamoli: despair

- Horner: despair

- Bodhi (CDB, 2000): despair

- Bodhi (NDB, 2012): anguish

- Norman: trouble (Sn.v.542).

===== Kodhūpāyāsa

For those calling _upāyāsa_ 'despair,' its combination with _kodha_ (anger)
is awkward because it then obviously approximates anger, and translators are
then cornered. Bodhi in 2012 even rejects 'anguish' in favour of 'displeased.'

- Horner: wrathful rage (M.1.360).

- Bodhi: anger and irritation (M.1.360).

- Bodhi: despair due to anger (S.3.109).

- Bodhi: angry and displeased (A.1.124).

- DOP: angry and annoyed

===== Vexation: happy solution

_Upāyāsa_ can in all contexts be rendered 'vexation'.

=== Upekkhā

==== Renderings

- _upekkhindriyaṃ_: the faculty of physical-plus-psychological neutral
experience

- _gehasitā upekkhā_: laypersons' neutral attitude

- _upekkhā nekkhammasitā ti_: ascetics' neutral attitude

- _sāmisā upekkhā_: worldly neutral attitude

- _nirāmisā upekkhā_: unworldly neutral attitude

- _upekkhāsambojjhaṅgo_: enlightenment factor of detached awareness

- _upekkhā brahmavihāra_: divine abiding of [unlimited, all-encompassing]
detached awareness

- _upekkhako_: serene

- _upekkhā_: indifference

==== Introduction

===== Upekkhā: not equanimity

DOP calls _upekkhā_:

- disinterestedness, unaffectedness, lack of involvement or reaction.

PED calls it:

- looking on, hedonic neutrality or indifference, zero point between joy and
sorrow, disinterestedness, neutral feeling, equanimity.

Equanimity is not prominent here. Equanimity means 'steadiness of mind under
stress' (WordWeb), which is not the meaning of _upekkhā._ For example, in both
fourth jhāna and the divine abiding, _upekkhā_ occurs in conditions of
absolute serenity, not stress.

===== Upekkhā: neutral attitude

When PED calls _upekkhā_ 'zero point between joy and sorrow,' it shows that
English lacks a word for it. We call it 'neutral attitude.'

===== Enlightenment factor of upekkhā: carefully, passively observing

The nature of _upekkhā_ is effectively revealed in the descriptions of the
seven enlightenment factors of the _Sīla Sutta_. For the sake of comparison,
let us first see how some of the other factors are also revealed. The sutta
says:

[quote, S.5.67-69]
____
Whenever the body becomes tranquil and the mind becomes tranquil in a bhikkhu
whose mind is rapturous, on that occasion the enlightenment factor of
tranquillity is aroused in the bhikkhu

_Yasmiṃ samaye bhikkhave bhikkhuno pītimanassa kāyopi passambhati cittampi
passambhati passaddhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṃ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti_

Whenever his mind becomes collected in a bhikkhu whose body is tranquil and
joyful, on that occasion the enlightenment factor of inward collectedness is
aroused in the bhikkhu

_Yasmiṃ samaye bhikkhave bhikkhuno passaddhakāyassa sukhino cittaṃ
samādhiyati samādhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṃ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti._

When a bhikkhu carefully, passively observes the mind thus collected, on that
occasion the enlightenment factor of _upekkhā_ is aroused in the bhikkhu.

_Yasmiṃ samaye bhikkhave bhikkhu tathā samāhitaṃ cittaṃ sādhukaṃ
ajjhupekkhitā hoti. Upekkhāsambojjhaṅgo tasmiṃ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho
hoti._
____

Thus the nature of the enlightenment factors is found in their means of
cultivation:

- The enlightenment factor of tranquillity equals the bhikkhu's body and mind
becoming tranquil.

- The enlightenment factor of inward collectedness equals the bhikkhu's mind
becoming collected.

- The enlightenment factor of _upekkhā_ equals the bhikkhu carefully,
passively observing.

The PED calls _upekkhā_ 'looking on,' close to our term: 'detached awareness.'

===== Upekkhako of third jhāna: serenity not equanimity

The formula for third jhāna is:

[quote, S.4.236]
____
With the fading away of rapture, he abides serene, mindful, and fully
conscious, experiencing physical pleasure. He enters and abides in third jhāna
in which the Noble Ones declare that he abides serene, mindful, and in physical
pleasure

_pītiyā ca virāgā upekkhako ca viharati sato sampajāno sukhañca kāyena
paṭisaṃvedeti yaṃ taṃ ariyā ācikkhanti upekkhako satimā
sukhavihārīti taṃ tatiyajjhānaṃ upasampajja viharati._
____

Thus the _upekkhako_ of third jhāna is related to the fading away of rapture,
for which we use the word 'serene,' not 'equanimous' because, unlike fourth
jhāna, third jhāna is not stable:

[quote, M.1.454-5]
____
Third jhāna, I declare, is within the unstable. What there is within the
unstable? The serenity with physical pleasure that is unended.

_tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ... iñjitasmiṃ vadāmi kiñca tattha iñjitasmiṃ
yadeva tattha upekkhāsukhaṃ aniruddhaṃ hoti_

Fourth jhāna, I declare, is within the not-unstable.

_catutthaṃ jhānaṃ... aniñjitasmiṃ vadāmi._
____

If equanimity means 'steadiness of mind under stress,' then the _upekkhako_ of
unstable third jhāna cannot rationally be called equanimous.

===== Upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ: upekkhā and sati are purified in fourth jhāna

The formula for fourth jhāna is:

[quote, S.4.236-7]
____
With the abandonment of physical pleasure and pain, and following the vanishing
of psychological pleasure and pain, a bhikkhu enters and abides in fourth
jhāna, which is free of pleasure and pain, and [is imbued with] purified
detached awareness and mindfulness.

_idha bhikkhave bhikkhu sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā pubbeva
somanassadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamā adukkhamasukhaṃ
upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati._
____

In the term _upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ_, the relationship between fourth
jhāna, _upekkhā_, _and sati_ is unsettled. It has been translated as follows:

- Horner (1): fourth jhāna 'is entirely purified by equanimity and
mindfulness' (M.3.36).

- Horner (2): fourth jhāna 'consists of purity of mindfulness and
even-mindedness' (Vin.3.4).

- Bodhi (1): fourth jhāna has 'purity of mindfulness due to equanimity'
(M.3.252).

- Bodhi (2): fourth jhāna 'includes the purification of mindfulness by
equanimity' (A.5.31).

Thus Horner (1) says _upekkhā_ and _sati_ purify fourth jhāna, whereas Horner
(2) says _upekkhā_ and _sati_ are simply part of fourth jhāna. Bodhi (1&2)
says _sati_ is purified by _upekkhā_.

For us, we treat _upekkhā_ and _sati_ as near synonyms, and do not accept that
fourth jhāna is purified by these factors, but rather that these two factors
are purified in fourth jhāna. The situation is comparable to the meditation on
the four great material phenomena, where one detaches the mind from these
Elements (_cittaṃ virājeti_). This leads to the following statement:

[quote, M.3.244]
____
Then there remains only mental consciousness, purified and refined.

_Athāparaṃ viññāṇaṃ yeva avasissati parisuddhaṃ pariyodātaṃ_

_..._ What does one know with that mental consciousness? One knows what is
pleasant, one knows what is unpleasant, one knows what is neutral.

_Tena ca viññāṇena kiṃ vijānāti: sukhan ti pi vijānāti dukkhan ti pi
vijānāti adukkhamasukhan ti pi vijānāti._
____

In this meditation, by detaching the mind from the four great material
phenomena, advertence is purified and refined, and then one knows what is
pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral. Likewise, in fourth jhāna, with the
abandonment of pleasure and pain, detached awareness and mindfulness are
purified, and are then stable bases for contemplation:

[quote, D.1.79-86]
____
With his mind thus collected, purified, cleansed, unblemished, free of
defilement, pliable, wieldy, stable, and attained to imperturbability, the
bhikkhu directs and inclines it to the knowledge of the destruction of
perceptually obscuring states.

_So evaṃ samāhite citte parisuddhe pariyodāte anaṅgaṇe vigatūpakkilese
mudubhūte kammaniye ṭhite āneñjappatte āsavānaṃ khayañāṇāya
cittaṃ abhinīharati abhininnāmeti._
____

===== Upekkhindriya: the faculty of physical-plus-psychological neutral experience

The five faculties of sense impression are:

1. the faculty of physical pleasure: pleasure born of bodily sensation
+
****
_sukhindriyaṃ_: _kāyasamphassajaṃ sukhaṃ_
****

2. the faculty of physical pain: pain born of bodily sensation
+
****
_dukkhindriyaṃ_: _kāyasamphassajaṃ dukkhaṃ_
****

3. the faculty of psychological pleasure: pleasure born of mental sensation:
+
****
_somanassindriyaṃ_: _manosamphassajaṃ sukhaṃ_
****

4. the faculty of psychological pain: pain born of mental sensation.
+
****
_domanassindriyaṃ: manosamphassajaṃ dukkhaṃ_
****

5. the faculty of physical-plus-psychological neutral experience: whatever
sense impression there is, physical or psychological, that is neither pleasing
nor displeasing
+
****
_yaṃ kho bhikkhave kāyikaṃ vā cetasikaṃ vā neva sātaṃ nāsātaṃ
vedayitaṃ idaṃ vuccati bhikkhave upekkhindriyaṃ_ (S.5.211).
****

Thus the faculty of physical-plus-psychological neutral experience
(_upekkhindriya_) includes

1. physical neutral experience

2. psychological neutral experience

We call it 'physical experience' not 'bodily experience' because it is the
experience of all five of the external senses, not just the sense of touch. The
terms 'sense impression born of bodily sensation' are likewise not restricted
to physical touch because the five faculties of sense impression are a
comprehensive model, where the physical senses are considered part of the body,
giving rise to physical sense impressions.

===== Neutral attitude: counterpoint of joy and dejection

Neutral attitude is the counterpoint of joy and dejection. For example:

[quote, M.3.217]
____
In seeing a visible object via the visual sense

_cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā_

(...) one ponders a visible object which is the basis for joy

_somanassaṭṭhāniyaṃ rūpaṃ upavicarati_

(...) one ponders a visible object which is the basis for dejection,

_domanassaṭṭhāniyaṃ rūpaṃ upavicarati_

(...) one ponders a visible object which is the basis for a neutral attitude.

_upekkhaṭṭhāniyaṃ rūpaṃ upavicarati._
____

===== Neutral attitude: diversified and undiversified

Neutral attitude is either diversified or undiversified:

[quote, M.3.220]
____
What is the neutral attitude that is diversified, associated with diversity?

_upekkhā nānattā nānattasitā_

(...) There is a neutral attitude associated with visible objects, audible
objects... mentally known objects.

_atthi bhikkhave upekkhā rūpesu atthi saddesu atthi gandhesu atthi rasesu
atthi phoṭṭhabbesu._

(...) What is the neutral attitude that is undiversified, associated with
undiversity?

_upekkhā ekattā ekattasitā_

(...) There is a neutral attitude associated with the state of awareness of
boundless space, associated with the state of awareness of boundless mental
consciousness, associated with the state of awareness of nonexistence,
associated with the state of awareness neither having nor lacking perception.

_atthi bhikkhave upekkhā ākāsānañcāyatananissitā atthi
viññāṇañcāyatananissitā atthi ākiñcaññāyatananissitā atthi
nevasaññānāsaññāyatananissitā_

(...) In this regard, with the help of and by means of the neutral attitude that
is undiversified, associated with undiversity, abandon and transcend the
neutral attitude that is diversified, associated with diversity

_Tatra bhikkhave yā'yaṃ upekkhā ekattā ekattasitā taṃ nissāya taṃ
āgamma yā'yaṃ upekkhā nānattā nānattasitā taṃ pajahatha taṃ
samatikkamatha_

(...) With the help of and by means of the perception that "It is void of

===== The power of detached awareness

Detached awareness can be used in the battle against attachment, against
pleasure and pain, and against impossible comrades:

[quote, D.3.248-250]
____
If the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through [unlimited,
all-encompassing] detached awareness is developed and cultivated... it is
impossible, out of the question, that attachment would plague your mind. There
is no such possibility.

_yaṃ upekkhāya cetovimuttiyā bhāvitāya... rāgo cittaṃ pariyādāya
ṭhassatī ti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati._
____

[quote, S.4.71]
____
When touched by a tangible object do not be elated by pleasure. Do not tremble
when touched by pain. Maintain detached awareness towards physical sensation,
both pleasant and painful, not attracted or repelled by anything.

_Phassena phuṭṭho na sukhena majje +

[quote, M.2.242]
____
If a bhikkhu thinks 'I am not able to make that person emerge from what is
spiritually unwholesome and establish him in what is spiritually wholesome' he
should not spurn detached awareness towards such a person._

===== Upekkhā brahmavihāra: [unlimited, all-encompassing] detached awareness

The practices of _mettā_, _karuṇā_, _muditā_ and _upekkhā_ are sometimes
called the four divine abidings (_cattāro brahmavihārā_, D.2.196) and
sometimes the four unlimited states (_catasso appamaññā_, D.3.223).
Practising them together is called the 'unlimited liberation [from perceptually
obscuring states]' (_appamāṇā cetovimutti_, S.4.296). The _Mahāvedalla
Sutta_ (M.1.298) and _Godatta Sutta_ (S.4.296) say the 'makers of limitation'
(_pamāṇakaraṇo_) are _rāgo doso_ and _moho_ (_rāgo kho āvuso
pamāṇakaraṇo doso pamāṇakaraṇo moho pamāṇakaraṇo_). Therefore
the four _brahmavihāras_ should be practised unlimited by _rāgo doso_ and
_moho_. We call _upekkhā brahmavihārā_ '[unlimited, all-encompassing]
detached awareness.' It is for overcoming attachment, ill will, vexation,
disgust, and repugnance (N.B. _Upekkhā_ in both these quotes occurs in the
context of the divine abidings):

1. For this is the liberation from attachment, namely the liberation [from
perceptually obscuring states] through [unlimited, all-encompassing] detached
awareness.

****
_nissaraṇaṃ hetaṃ āvuso rāgassa yadidaṃ upekkhā cetovimutti_
(D.3.248-250).

2. 'The Blessed One abides in a state of [unlimited, all-encompassing] detached
awareness.' 'Jīvaka, any attachment, hatred, or undiscernment of reality
whereby ill will, vexation, disgust, or repugnance might arise have been
abandoned by the Perfect One... If what you said referred to that, then I allow
it to you.'
+
****
_bhagavā hi bhante upekkhāvihārī ti... vyāpādavā vihesavā assa assa
arati vā assa paṭighavā assa so rāgo so doso so moho tathāgatassa

upekkhā gehasitā

laypersons' neutral attitude

The ignorant Everyman experiences laypersons' joy when he attains objects of
desire (_gehasitaṃ somanassaṃ_), laypersons' displeasure when he fails to
attain them (_gehasitaṃ domanassaṃ_), and a third emotional reaction,
laypersons' neutral attitude, _gehasitā upekkhā_. This is not associated with
attaining or not attaining. It is simply an emotional reaction to objects,
either physical or mental. For example:

[quote, M.3.218]
____
In seeing a visible object via the visual sense, there arises in him the
neutral attitude of the foolish Everyman who is undiscerning of reality. The
neutral attitude such as this does not transcend the visible object. Therefore
it is called the laypersons' neutral attitude.

objects, their changeableness, passing away and ending, and thinks, 'Formerly
as well as now all these visible objects... mentally known objects are
unlasting, existentially void, and destined to change,' from seeing this thus
according to reality with perfect penetrative discernment, detached awareness
arises.

_rūpānaṃ... dhammā tveva aniccataṃ viditvā

Neutral attitude such as this transcends the visible objects... mentally known
objects.

____
Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties of sense impression. What five? The
faculty of physical pleasure, the faculty of psychological pleasure, the
faculty of physical pain, the faculty of psychological pain, the faculty of
physical-plus-psychological neutral experience.

_sukhindriyaṃ somanassindriyaṃ dukkhindriyaṃ domanassindriyaṃ

Dependent on a sensation to be experienced as physically pleasant, the faculty
of physical pleasure arises. Being physically pleased, he knows that: 'I am
physically pleased.'

_Sukhavedanīyaṃ bhikkhave phassaṃ paṭicca uppajjati sukhindriyaṃ. So
sukhito va samāno sukhitosmi ti pajānāti_

Dependent on a sensation to be experienced as physically unpleasant, the
faculty of physical pain arises. Being physically hurt, he knows that: 'I am
physically hurt.'

_Dukkhavedanīyaṃ bhikkhave phassaṃ paṭiccauppajjati dukkhindriyaṃ. So
dukkhito va samāno dukkhitosmī ti pajānāti._

Dependent on a sensation to be experienced as psychologically pleasant, the
faculty of psychological pleasure arises. Being psychologically pleased he
discerns: 'I am psychologically pleased.'

_Somanassavedanīyaṃ bhikkhave phassaṃ paṭicca uppajjati

undiversified, associated with undiversity, where grasping of worldly pleasures
ceases without remainder.

If a bhikkhu's mind is imbued with the perception of the unloveliness [of the
body], his mind draws back, bends back, turns away from involvement in sexual
intercourse and is not attracted to it, and either indifference or loathing is
established in him.

If a bhikkhu's mind is imbued with the perception of [the ever-present

hankering for life, and is not attracted to it, and either indifference or
loathing is established in him.

If a bhikkhu's mind is imbued with the perception of the loathsome nature of
digestion, his mind draws back, bends back, turns away from craving for
flavours and is not attracted to them, and either indifference or loathing is

In this regard, in seeing a visible object via the visual sense, there arises
in a bhikkhu pleasure, or displeasure, or pleasure plus displeasure.

_cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā uppajjati manāpaṃ uppajjati amanāpaṃ uppajjati
manāpāmanāpaṃ._

He knows that 'This pleasure has arisen in me, this displeasure... this
pleasure plus displeasure has arisen in me.'

_uppannaṃ kho me idaṃ manāpaṃ uppannaṃ amanāpaṃ uppannaṃ
manāpāmanāpaṃ_

And that is originated, self-evident, dependently arisen.

_tañca kho saṅkhataṃ oḷārikaṃ paṭiccasamuppannaṃ_

But this is peaceful, this is sublime, namely, detached awareness.

_Etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ yadidaṃ upekkhā ti._

With that, the arisen pleasure... displeasure... pleasure plus displeasure
ceases, and detached awareness is established.

_Tassa taṃ uppannaṃ manāpaṃ uppannaṃ amanāpaṃ uppannaṃ

Just as a man with good eyes, having closed them, might open them; or having
opened them, might close them, that is how quickly, how rapidly, how easily, no
matter what it refers to, the pleasure... displeasure... pleasure plus

=== Ubhatobhāgavimutto; Paññāvimutto; Paññāvimuttin; Cetovimuttin

==== Renderings

states] both through [penetrative discernment and through attaining the
immaterial states of awareness]

- _paññāvimutto_: one who is liberated [from perceptually obscuring states]
through penetrative discernment

- _paññāvimuttin_: one who is liberated [from uninsightfulness] through
penetrative discernment

- _cetovimuttin_: one who is liberated [from attachment through inward calm]

==== Introduction

===== Paths to arahantship

Arahantship is gained either 1) by first attaining the four jhānas or 2), by
first attaining the immaterial states of awareness, says the _Jhānanissaya
Sutta_:

[quote, A.4.422]
____
The destruction of perceptually obscuring states depends on [attaining]
first jhāna, I declare... depends on [attaining] the state of awareness of
boundless space, I declare... etc.

_Paṭhamampahaṃ bhikkhave jhānaṃ nissāya āsavānaṃ khayaṃ
vadāmi... Ākāsānañcāyatanampahaṃ bhikkhave nissāya āsavānaṃ
khayaṃ vadāmi..._
____

This gives rise to two types of arahants: _ubhatobhāgavimutto_ and
_paññāvimutto_:

1. If arahantship is gained through the immaterial states of awareness, the
bhikkhu is called 'one who is liberated [from perceptually obscuring states]
both through [penetrative discernment and through attaining the immaterial
states of awareness]' (_ubhatobhāgavimutto_). The following passage is the
basis of us saying this:
+
[quote, M.1.477-9]
____
And what is the individual liberated [from perceptually obscuring states] both
through [penetrative discernment and through attaining the immaterial states of
awareness]?

_Katamo ca bhikkhave puggalo ubhatobhāgavimutto_

(...) In this regard, some person abides touching with his very being those
immaterial states of awareness, those peaceful states of refined awareness that
transcend the refined material states of awareness, and by seeing [reality]
with penetrative discernment, his perceptually obscuring states are destroyed.

_idha bhikkhave ekacco puggalo ye te santā vimokkhā atikkamma rūpe āruppā
te kāyena phassitvā viharati paññāya cassa disvā āsavā parikkhīṇā
honti._

2. If arahantship is gained through the jhānas, the bhikkhu is called 'one who
is liberated [from perceptually obscuring states] through penetrative
discernment' (_paññāvimutto_). The following passage is the basis of us
saying this:
+
[quote, M.1.477-9]
____
And what is the individual liberated [from perceptually obscuring states]

(...) In this regard, some person does not abide touching with his very being
those immaterial states of awareness, those peaceful states of refined
awareness that transcend the refined material states of awareness, but by
seeing [reality] with penetrative discernment, his perceptually obscuring
states are destroyed.

parikkhīṇā honti._
____

===== Paññāvimutti and Cetovimutti: review

Regarding _paññāvimutti_ and _cetovimutti,_ we have shown (sv _Cetovimutti_)
that:

1. the terms mean:

- _paññāvimutti_: liberation [from uninsightfulness] through penetrative
discernment

- _cetovimutti_: liberation [from attachment through inward calm]

2. _paññāvimutti_ and _cetovimutti_ correspond to _vipassanā_
('insightfulness') and _samatha_ ('inward calm') respectively.

3. the terms do not necessarily imply arahantship. So the enlightened
connotations of _paññāvimutti_ do not necessarily apply to _paññāvimutto_.

===== Paññāvimuttin and Cetovimuttin

Therefore let us now consider _paññāvimuttin_ and _cetovimuttin_ which occur
only in the _Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta_. The terms stem etymologically from
_paññāvimutti_ and _cetovimutti_ and therefore mean:

- _paññāvimuttin_: one who is liberated [from uninsightfulness] through
penetrative discernment

- _cetovimuttin_: one who is liberated [from attachment through inward calm]

In the _Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta_, after the Buddha had explained the path and
practice to abandon the five ties to individual existence in the low plane of
existence, Ānanda enquired:

[quote, M.1.437]
____
-- Bhante, if this is the path and practice to abandon the five ties to
individual existence in the low plane of existence, then how is that some
bhikkhus here are liberated [from attachment through inward calm]
(_cetovimuttino_), while some are liberated [from uninsightfulness] through
penetrative discernment (_paññāvimuttino_)?

_Eso ce bhante maggo esā paṭipadā pañcannaṃ orambhāgiyānaṃ
saṃyojanānaṃ pahānāya atha kiñcarahi idhekacce bhikkhū cetovimuttino
ekacce bhikkhū paññāvimuttino ti._

-- The difference here, Ānanda, is in their [mental] faculties, I declare.

_Ettha kho tesāhaṃ ānanda indriyavemattataṃ vadāmī ti._
____

This confirms that the _paññāvimuttin_ and _cetovimuttin_ are not
necessarily arahants, unlike the _paññāvimutto._

===== Commentary: -mutto and -muttin

The commentary to the _Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta_ says: _Samathavaseneva hi
gacchantesu ekassa bhikkhuno cittekaggatā dhuraṃ hoti so cetovimutto nāma
hoti. Ekassa paññā dhuraṃ hoti, so paññāvimutto nāma hoti.
Vipassanāvaseneva ca gacchantesu ekassa paññā dhuraṃ hoti, so
paññāvimutto nāma hoti._

Thus it mistakenly says _paññāvimutto_ and _cetovimutto_ where Ānanda had
said _paññāvimuttino_ and _cetovimuttino_. Nonetheless, it correctly links
_paññāvimutto_ to _vipassanā_, and _cetovimutto_ to _samatha._

- _ekamantaṃ_: at a respectful distance

==== Introduction

===== Sitting at a respectful distance

Horner says that _ekamantaṃ nisīdi_ means 'literally sat down to one side,
or end. In sitting down in the presence of an honoured person, care should be
taken not to sit down in any of the six wrong ways. These are

- too far

- too near

- to windward

- on a higher seat

- too much in front

- too much behind' (BD Part 2 p.42 n.5).

Accordingly, she renders the term as 'he sat down at a respectful distance.'

===== 'Respectful distance' and 'appropriate distance'

[quote, Vin.2.216]
____
Horner's phrase 'at a respectful distance' and our preference 'at an
appropriate distance' would seem to be justified by comparison with the
etiquette concerning almsround. According to this, when a bhikkhu approaches a
house for food, he should not stand too far away, he should not stand too close.

_Nātidure ṭhātabbaṃ. Nāccāsanne ṭhātabbaṃ._

'At an appropriate distance' would be a good way to negotiate the following
passage:

Going on uninterrupted house-to-house almsround in Rājagaha, the Blessed One

==== Introduction

===== Khaggavisāṇa means 'rhinoceros horn'

Norman has carefully explained why _khaggavisāṇa_ means 'rhinoceros horn'
not 'rhinoceros.' He concludes that:

- 'When the Pāli can be so translated, when the earliest interpretation takes
it that way, and when the Indian rhinoceros is unique among animals in India in
having only one horn, it seems certain to me that the reference is to the
single horn, and I think that there is no problem if we translate: 'Let him
wander all by himself (_eko adutiyo_) having a resemblance to the rhinoceros
horn, which is also _eko adutiyo_' (GD p.154).

But Norman is not curious to understand why translators have persisted to
render _khaggavisāṇa_ as 'rhinoceros,' and why even today we find it as a
meaning in the 2001 Dictionary of Pāli. So let us see why that is.

===== Persistently 'rhinoceros': the underlying problems

The continual refrain of the _Khaggavisāṇa Sutta_ is _eko care
khaggavisāṇakappo_, and many would agree with Norman when he says it means
one should 'wander solitary as a rhinoceros horn.' But this is unconvincing for
two reasons:

1. It is unconvincing because of the obvious fact that although rhinceroses
wander, their horns really do not. But the impossible conception of 'wandering
horns' is not the only problem of Norman's translation.

2. Another problem of 'wandering solitary as a rhinoceros horn' is where the
bhikkhu is in fact stationary. For example in verse in Sn.v.72 Norman says 'one
should resort to secluded abodes, one should wander solitary as a rhinoceros
horn.' And, even more problematic, in verse Sn.v.74, which apparently concerns
the time of death, Norman says 'not trembling at [the time of] the complete
destruction of life, one should wander solitary as a rhinoceros horn.'

We translate the verses like this:

[quote, Sn.v.72]
____
Like a strong-toothed lion, the king of beasts, having overpowered [Māra],
having overcome [the Destroyer], conducting oneself [in accordance with the
teaching], one should make use of secluded abodes. One should live the
religious life as solitarily as a rhinoceros horn.

_Sīho yathā dāṭhabalī pasayha rājā migānaṃ abhibhuyya cārī +
Sevetha pantāni senāsanāni eko care khaggavisāṇakappo._
____

[quote, Sn.v.74]
____

slashed the ties to individual existence, being unterrified at the [imminent]
destruction of one's life, one should live the religious life as solitarily as
a rhinoceros horn.

_Rāgañca dosañca pahāya mohaṃ sandālayitvāna saṃyojanāni +
Asantasaṃ jīvitasaṅkhayamhi eko care khaggavisāṇakappo._
____

===== Carati means brahmacariyaṃ carati

Both problems are resolved if we recognise _eko care khaggavisāṇakappo_ as
an abbreviation for _eko brahmacariyaṃ care khaggavisāṇakappo_ 'live the
religious life as solitarily as a rhinoceros horn.' The abbreviation of
_carati_ in this way occurs elsewhere in the scriptures, not only in the
_Khaggavisāṇa Sutta_, but only in verses, and is therefore to be explained
and excused on metrical grounds. See Illustrations below. In prose
_brahmacariyaṃ carati_ is common enough, but never abbreviated. Even in verse
it is sometimes unabbreviated, for example:

==== Introduction

===== Aneñja: eleven spellings

PED says of _aneñja_ that the Pāli editions 'show a great variance of
spelling, based on manuscript vacillation, in part also due to confusion of
derivation.' It lists eleven spellings: _aṇañja, aneñja, aneja, anejja,
anañja, āṇañja, āṇeñja, ānañca, ānañja, ānejja, āneñja_.

===== Āneñja and aneñja: relationship to iñjati

Norman considers _ejaṃ_ and _iñjita_ to be related, and says his
translations "com-motions" and "e-motions" are an attempt to get the wordplay
on the two forms which are from the same root (Norman, GD p.304 n.750-51). But
DOP is less sure, saying that _āneñja_ and _aneñja_ may be derived from
_iñjati_, with a question mark, thus: 'from _iñjati_?' In practice the
uncertainty is irrelevant because the scriptures treat the words as synonyms.
For example, Sn.v.750-1 says:

- Whatever suffering arises, all of it arises dependent on spiritual
instability (_iñjitapaccayā_)... Therefore having relinquished spiritual
instability (_ejaṃ vossajja_), imperturbable (_anejo_) and free of grasping,
the bhikkhu should mindfully fulfil the ideals of religious asceticism
(Sn.v.750-1).

So _ejaṃ_ and _iñjati_ can be considered together.

===== Ejā: not desire

_Ejā_ was formerly considered part of desire. For example, PED (1905)
suggested 'cravings.' But this is now rejected by DOP (2001) which calls it
'motion, disturbance, agitation, emotion.'

===== Root word: perturbable

'Perturbable' has become the generally accepted root word for most members of
the word family. Thus Bodhi calls _āneñja_ 'imperturbable', and _iñjita_
'perturbable'. DOP agrees, saying _āneñja_ means 'unmoved, not to be stirred,
imperturbable.' This rendering is justified, firstly by similes that compare
_anejo_ to calm lakes or immoveable mountains (_pabbato viya so ṭhito anejo_
Ud.27), and secondly by the word's co-occurrence with _ṭhito_ 'inwardly
stable.' All evidence therefore negates the possibility of 'desire.'

===== Imperturbability: two connotations

Imperturbability has two connotations:

1. Firstly, fourth jhāna and immaterial states of awareness. All levels of
_samādhi_ below fourth jhāna lie 'within the unstable' (_iñjitasmiṃ_,
locative), whereas fourth jhāna is 'within the not-unstable'
(_aniñjitasmiṃ_, M.1.454-5). To attain fourth jhāna is to attain
imperturbability (_āneñjappatte_, D.1.76), where one might sit in [a state
of] imperturbable inward collectedness (_āneñjena samādhinā nisinno hoti_,
Ud.27), a state where one's mind is unshakeable (_ṭhite_, M.3.136).

2. Secondly, arahantship. An arahant has 'realised the Imperturbable'
(_anejaṃ te anuppattā,_ S.3.83). In other words, because they are liberated,
they are free of spiritual instability (_neva sammā vimuttānaṃ buddhānaṃ
atthi iñjitan ti_), and it is impossible to arouse fear, panic, terror in them
(_bhayaṃ chambhitattaṃ lomahaṃsaṃ_, S.1.109).

===== 'The Imperturbable'

We have seen in the paragraph above that 'the Imperturbable' means arahantship.
However it can also mean refined meditation states, which we detail below:

[quote, M.2.262]
____
When there is serenity, he either attains the Imperturbable now, or else he is
intent upon discernment.

_Sampasāde sati etarahi vā āneñjaṃ samāpajjati paññāya vā
adhimuccati._
____

We have seen in the section above that fourth jhāna is 'within the
not-unstable' (_aniñjitasmiṃ_, M.1.454-5), which can be regarded as part of
the Imperturbable because _aniñjita_ and _āneñja_ are treated as synonyms in
the suttas. The immaterial states are also part of it:

[quote, A.2.184]
____
And how is a bhikkhu one who has attained the Imperturbable? In this regard, by
completely transcending refined material states of awareness, with the
vanishing of states of refined awareness involving physical sensation, not
focusing upon states of refined awareness involving the external senses, a
bhikkhu enters and abides in the state of awareness of boundless space where
one perceives that space is boundless... By completely transcending the state
of awareness of nonexistence, a bhikkhu enters and abides in the state of
awareness neither having nor lacking perception.

===== Imperturbability of arahantship: the basis

Sometimes the imperturbability of arahantship is linked to other terms, which
shows the basis for the arahant's imperturbability:

1. The dispelling of fondness ('Dispel fondness for these. Be imperturbable,'
_ettha vinodaya chandamanejo,_ S.1.186).

2. Abandoning the perception of Self. For example, to overcome spiritual
instability (_ejā_) and attain imperturbability (_anejo_), one should avoid,
for example, thinking of the visual sense in personal terms (_cakkhuṃ na
maññeyya_, S.4.65). See Glossary sv _Maññati._

===== Iñjita three terms

_Iñjita_, past participle of _iñjati_, means 'moved, perturbed,' says DOP,
and the noun is 'movement, disturbance.' But we render it with three terms:

1. spiritual instability

2. trembling

3. the unstable

We illustrate these as follows:

===== 1) Iñjita: spiritual instability

[quote, S.4.203]
____
The notion "I am" is a matter of spiritual instability,

_asmī ti bhikkhave iñjitametaṃ_

'I am this' is a matter of spiritual instability

_ayamahamasmī ti iñjitametaṃ_

'I will be' is a matter of spiritual instability

_bhavissanti iñjitametaṃ_

'I will not be' is a matter of spiritual instability

_na bhavissanti iñjitametaṃ._
____

===== 2) Iñjita: trembling

Māra, the Maleficent One, wishing to arouse fear in the Buddha shattered a
number of huge boulders nearby. The Buddha said:

[quote, S.1.109]
____
'Even if you shake this entire Vulture Peak

_Sacemaṃ kevalaṃ sabbaṃ gijjhakūṭaṃ caleyyasi_

There is no trembling in fully liberated enlightened ones.'

_Neva sammā vimuttānaṃ buddhānaṃ atthi iñjitan ti._
____

===== 3) Iñjita: the unstable

[quote, M.1.454-5]
____
First jhāna, I declare, is within the unstable.

_paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ... iñjitasmiṃ vadāmi._

What there is within the unstable? The thinking and pondering that are unended.

_Kiñca tattha iñjitasmiṃ: yadeva tattha vitakkavicārā aniruddhā honti
idaṃ tattha iñjitasmiṃ._
____

===== Aniñjita: the not-unstable

DOP says the negative _aniñjita_ means 'not perturbed, lack of disturbance,
quiet,' where we say 'not-unstable,' as follows:

[quote, M.1.454-5]
____
First jhāna, I declare, is within the unstable.

_paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ... iñjitasmiṃ vadāmi._

What there is within the unstable? The thinking and pondering that are unended.

_Kiñca tattha iñjitasmiṃ: yadeva tattha vitakkavicārā aniruddhā honti
idaṃ tattha iñjitasmiṃ_

Second jhāna, I declare, is within the unstable.

_dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ... iñjitasmiṃ vadāmi._

What there is within the unstable? The rapture and physical pleasure that are
unended.

_yadeva tattha pītisukhaṃ aniruddhaṃ hoti._

Third jhāna, I declare, is within the unstable.

_tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ... iñjitasmiṃ vadāmi_

What there is within the unstable? The serenity with physical pleasure that is
unended.

_yadeva tattha upekkhāsukhaṃ aniruddhaṃ hoti._

Fourth jhāna, I declare, is within the not-unstable.

_catutthaṃ jhānaṃ... aniñjitasmiṃ vadāmi._

===== Karmically neutral deeds

_Āneñja_ is used to describe deeds that are neither meritorious nor
demeritorious. We call these deeds 'karmically neutral.'

[quote, S.2.82]
____
Bhikkhus, if someone who has acquiesced in uninsightfulness into reality
undertakes a karmically consequential deed that is meritorious, his stream of
sense consciousness (_viññāṇaṃ_) is furnished with merit;

_Avijjāgatoyaṃ bhikkhave purisapuggalo puññaṃ ce saṅkhāraṃ
abhisaṅkharoti puññopagaṃ hoti viññāṇaṃ._

(...) If he undertakes a karmically consequential deed that is demeritorious, his
stream of sense consciousness is furnished with demerit;

_Apuññaṃ ce saṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharoti apuññopagaṃ hoti
viññāṇaṃ._

(...) If he undertakes a karmically consequential deed that is karmically
neutral, his stream of sense consciousness is furnished with what is karmically
neutral.

_Āneñjaṃ ce saṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharoti āneñjūpagaṃ hoti
viññāṇaṃ._

(...) When a bhikkhu has abandoned uninsightfulness into reality (_avijjā_) and
aroused insightfulness into reality (_vijjā_), then, with the fading away of
uninsightfulness into reality and the arising of insightfulness into reality,
he does not undertake a karmically consequential deed that is meritorious,
demeritorious, or karmically neutral.

_Yato kho bhikkhave bhikkhuno avijjā pahīṇā hoti vijjā uppannā so
avijjāvirāgā vijjūppādā neva puññābhisaṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharoti.
Na apuññābhisaṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharoti. Na āneñjābhisaṅkhāraṃ
abhisaṅkharoti._

==== Renderings

- _ogha_: flood

- _ogha_: the flood [of suffering]

- _oghatiṇṇa_: flood-crosser, one who has crossed the flood [of suffering]

==== Introduction

===== PED: the old word 'ogha'

PED (sv _Ogha_) says that one who has 'crossed the flood' (_oghatiṇṇa_) is
ascribed the mental and moral qualifications of the arahant, but adds that
'less often we have details of what the flood consists of.' It says that
'towards the end of the Nikāya period we find, for the first time, the use of
the word in the plural, and the mention of the four _oghas_ identical with the
four _āsavas_... The 5^th^ century commentators persist in the error of
explaining the old word _ogha_, used in the singular, as referring to the four
_āsavas.'_

===== The ocean of the six senses

Before discussing 'the flood,' we will first deal with 'the ocean.' This has
two meanings:

1. the ocean of the six senses (_cakkhu bhikkhave purisassa samuddo_ etc,
S.4.157) in which 'ocean currents' are the six sense objects. This is the ocean
that the arahant has crossed (_atari cakkhu samuddaṃ_: crossed the ocean of
the eye). This ocean with its six sense objects is elsewhere called
'everything' (_cakkhuñceva rūpā ca... mano ca dhammā ca idaṃ vuccati
bhikkhave sabbaṃ_ S.4.15). Therefore, in crossing the ocean, one crosses over
everything.

2. the ocean [of the six sensuous objects]':

[quote, S.4.158]
____
There are visible objects known via the visual sense that are likeable,
loveable, pleasing, agreeable, connected with sensuous pleasure, and charming.
In the [terminology of the] Noble One's training system this is called the
ocean.

_Santi bhikkhave cakkhuviññeyyā rūpā iṭṭhā kantā manāpā piyarūpā
kāmūpasaṃhitā rajanīyā ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave ariyassa vinaye samuddo._

kāmūpasaṃhitā rajanīyā. Ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave ariyassa vinaye

____

===== The flood of birth, old age, and death

But in crossing the flood, what is crossed? The nature of the flood is revealed
in the scriptures as follows:

1. In the _Pārāyanavaggo_, the Chapter on The Way to the Far Shore, Venerable
Mettagū called it 'the flood of birth, old age, grief, and lamentation'
(_oghaṃ jātijaraṃ sokapariddavañca_).

2. The bhikkhunī Upasamā told herself to cross the flood, the realm of death
so hard to get beyond (_upasame tare oghaṃ maccudheyyaṃ suduttaraṃ_
Thī.v.10), where 'flood' therefore means the realm of death.

3. Venerable Kappa compared being afflicted by old age and death
(_jarāmaccuparetānaṃ_) to standing in the middle of a lake when a very
fearful flood has arisen (_majjhe sarasmiṃ tiṭṭhataṃ oghe jāte
mahabbhaye_ Sn.v.1092) where 'flood' therefore means the flood of old age and
death.

4. Venerable Nanda referred to those who had not overcome birth and old age
(_nātariṃsu jātijaranti_ Sn.v.1080-1082) as 'not flood-crossers'
(_anoghatiṇṇo_), where 'flood' therefore means the flood of birth and old
age.

===== The flood of dukkhakkhandha

The scriptures show that 'old age and death' is an abbreviation for the whole
mass of suffering (_dukkhakkhandha_), as follows:

1. In the _Mahānidāna Sutta_ the Buddha initially said birth produces old age
and death, grief, lamentation, physical pain, psychological pain, and vexation
(_jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇaṃ sokaparidevadukkhadomanassūpāyāsā_
D.2.56), and then said'birth produces old age and death' (_jātipaccayā
jarāmaraṇan ti_). The full meaning of the condensed second statement is in
the first statement.

2. In the _Parivīmaṃsana Sutta_ (S.2.80) a bhikkhu investigates 'the many
and various kinds of suffering that arise in the world [headed by] old age and
death' (_anekavidhaṃ nānappakārakaṃ dukkhaṃ loke uppajjati
jarāmaraṇaṃ_). The bhikkhu then realises when there is birth, then old age
and death come to be (_jātiyā sati jarāmaraṇaṃ hoti_). Here 'old age and
death' stands for 'the many and various kinds of suffering that arise in the
world [headed by] old age and death.'

3. Venerable Mettagū first called the flood 'birth, old age, grief, and
lamentation' (_jātijaraṃ sokapariddavañca_ Sn.v.1052), he then said that
one who had 'crossed this flood' (_oghamimaṃ atāri_) had overcome birth and
old age (_atāri so jāti jaran ti_, Sn.v.1060) where 'birth and old age'
stands for what he previously called birth, old age, grief, and lamentation.

===== Oghatiṇṇo and dukkhotiṇṇā

That 'flood' means 'flood of _dukkhakkhandha'_ is also evident in the
association of _otiṇṇā_ and _tiṇṇā_. When young men take up the
ascetic way of life, they do so with the thought:

[quote, "S.3.93, It.89"]
____
'I am overwhelmed by suffering, overcome by suffering.

_dukkhotiṇṇā dukkhaparetā_

(...) Perhaps an ending of this whole mass of suffering might be discerned!'

_appeva nāma imassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa antakiriyā paññāyethā ti._
____

So _dukkhotiṇṇā_ is shown to mean _dukkhakkhandhotiṇṇā_. But
flood-crossers are called _oghatiṇṇo_ (Sn.v.108), where _ogha_ corresponds
to _dukkha_, and therefore to _dukkhakkhandha._

===== Oghataraṇa Sutta

In the _Oghataraṇa Sutta_ (S.1.1) a deva asks the Buddha how he crossed 'the
flood' (_kathaṃ nu tvaṃ mārisa oghamatarī ti_) without explaining which
flood. Bodhi says the four floods are meant (CDB p.341 n.1). But the deva
clarified the issue by equating 'crossing the flood' to 'overcoming attachment
to the world [of phenomena]':

[quote, S.1.1]
____
At long last, I see a Brahman who has realised the Untroubled who, without
halting or overstraining, has overcome attachment to the world [of phenomena]

_Cirassaṃ vata passāmi brāhmaṇaṃ parinibbutaṃ +
Appatiṭṭhaṃ anāyūhaṃ tiṇṇaṃ loke visattikaṃ._
____

That the flood in the _Oghataraṇa Sutta_ can again be taken as the flood of
_dukkhakkhandha_, in spite of the later reference to attachment, is proven by
comparison with the _Mettagū Sutta_ where the same thing happens. Firstly
Venerable Mettagū asked:

____
How do the wise cross the flood of birth, old age, grief, and lamentation?

_Kathaṃ nu dhīrā vitaranti oghaṃ jātijaraṃ sokapariddavañca_
____

The Buddha replied:

[quote, Sn.v.1052-3]
____
I shall explain the teaching to you, which is fathomable in this lifetime,
which is not just hearsay, understanding which, one living the religious life,
one who is mindful, would overcome attachment to the world [of phenomena].

_Kittayissāmi te dhammaṃ, diṭṭhe dhamme anitihaṃ +
Yaṃ viditvā sato caraṃ, tare loke visattikaṃ._
____

So when the deva asked about crossing the flood, he meant the flood of
_dukkhakkhandha_. Both references show this is accomplished by overcoming
attachment to the world of phenomena.

===== In conclusion: flood [of suffering]

In conclusion, 'ocean' means 'everything' and _ogha_ means 'the flood of the
whole mass of suffering.' But 'of the whole mass' is redundant, so we call
it 'flood [of suffering].'

The ascetic Sabhiya said to the Buddha:

You have left the darkness [of hell] and the flood [of suffering]...

_oghatamagā_

You have reached the end of suffering, gone beyond suffering

_antagūsi pāragū dukkhassa._
____

Comment:

The commentary says _oghatamagā_ stands for _ogha-tamaṃ agā_ where darkness
is paired with the flood of suffering. Like 'flood,' darkness in the scriptures
means intense suffering, as follows:

1. Having passed on they go to darkness, falling headlong into hell
+
****
_pecca tamaṃ vajanti ye patanti sattā nirayaṃ avaṃsirā_ (Sn.v.248).
****

2. Defilement is the road to hell. Reaching [on rebirth] the plane of
damnation, going from womb to womb, from darkness to darkness, such a bhikkhu
goes to misery when he passes on.
+
****
_maggaṃ nirayagāminaṃ; vinipātaṃ samāpanno gabbhā gabbhaṃ tamā
tamaṃ save tādisako bhikkhu pecca dukkhaṃ nigacchati_ (Sn.v.278).
****

3. How is a person heading from darkness to darkness? In this regard, some
person has been reborn in a low family... after death he is reborn in the plane
of sub-human existence, in the plane of misery, in the plane of damnation, or
in hell.
+

- _opanayika_: personally applicable

- _opanayika_: personally significant

- _attūpanāyikaṃ_: with reference to oneself

- _attūpanāyikaṃ_: involving comparison with oneself

==== Introduction

===== Fit for bringing near

_Opanayika_ has long been rendered as 'leading onward' or 'leading to
salvation.' But DOP says it means 'fit for bringing near, for taking to
oneself; fit for making use of; deserving to be used,' and says it is derived
from _upanaya_, which means 'bringing near; bringing near (to death);
application.'

===== Applicable

Bodhi renders _opanayika_ as 'applicable' in accordance with the
_Visuddhimagga_ (Vism.217) where he says 'the word is glossed by the gerundive
_upanetabba_, "to be brought near, to be applied"' (CDB p.353 n.33).

===== Personally applicable; personally significant

The scriptures use _opanayika_ in two situations:

1. Firstly, regarding the teachings, where we call it 'personally applicable.'
See Illustrations.

2. Secondly, regarding the elimination of attachment (_rāga_) and of previous
karmically consequential conduct (_purāṇañca kammaṃ_). The text says the
elimination of attachment and previous karmically consequential conduct is
_opanayikā_. But 'elimination' cannot rationally be called 'applicable,' so we
say 'personally significant.' This is in accordance with DOP's 'fit for taking
to oneself; deserving to be used.'

[quote, A.1.221]
____
He undertakes no new karmically consequential conduct; as to previous
karmically consequential conduct, he nullifies it by the gradual experience [of
its consequences]. Its elimination is discernable in this lifetime, realisable

wise for themselves.

_So navañca kammaṃ na karoti. Purāṇañca kammaṃ phussa phussa

===== Attūpanāyiko: with/through reference to oneself

_Attūpanāyiko_ means either:

1. 'with reference to oneself,' or

2. 'involving comparison with oneself.'

In this regard, in seeing a visible object via the visual sense a bhikkhu

On what grounds is the teaching fathomable in this lifetime, realisable in the
here and now, intriguing, personally applicable, to be realised by the wise for
themselves?

_sandiṭṭhiko dhammo sandiṭṭhiko dhammo'ti bho gotama vuccati
kittāvatā nu kho bho gotama sandiṭṭhiko dhammo hoti akāliko ehipassiko

One who is attached, overpowered, and overcome by attachment, is intent upon
his own harm, upon the harm of others, upon the harm of both, and so
experiences psychological pain and dejection.

_Ratto kho brāhmaṇa rāgena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto attavyābādhāyapi
ceteti paravyābādhāyapi ceteti ubhayavyābādhāyapi ceteti. Cetasikampi

But if attachment be abandoned he is not intent upon his own harm, upon the
harm of others, upon the harm of both, and thus does not experience
psychological pain and dejection.

_Rāge pahīṇe nevattavyābādhāyapi ceteti. Na paravyābādhāyapi ceteti
na ubhayavyābādhāyapi ceteti. Na cetasikaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ
paṭisaṃvedeti._

One who is attached, overpowered, and overcome by attachment, misconducts
himself by way of body, speech, and mind. But if attachment be abandoned he
does not do so.

_Ratto kho brāhmaṇa rāgena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto kāyena
duccaritaṃ carati vācāya duccaritaṃ carati manasā duccaritaṃ carati
rāge pahīṇe neva kāyena duccaritaṃ carati na vācāya duccaritaṃ
carati na manasā duccaritaṃ carati._

One who is attached, overpowered, and overcome by attachment, does not discern
according to reality his own well-being, nor that of others, nor that of both
himself and others. But if attachment be abandoned he discerns this.

_Ratto kho brāhmaṇa rāgena abhibhūto pariyādinnacitto attatthampi
yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti paratthampi yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti
ubhayatthampi yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Rāge pahīṇe attatthampi

There are, headman, these three kinds of elimination that are discernable in

_Tisso imā gāmaṇi sandiṭṭhikā nijjarā akālikā ehipassikā

Someone is attached, and because of attachment he is intent upon his own harm,
upon the harm of others, upon the harm of both.

_Yaṃ ratto rāgādhikaraṇaṃ attavyābādhāyapi ceteti
paravyābādhāyapi ceteti ubhayavyābādhāyapi ceteti_

When attachment is abandoned, he is not intent upon his own harm, or the harm
of others, or the harm of both.

_rāge pahīne neva attavyābādhāyapi ceteti na paravyābādhāyapi ceteti na

____
I will expound for your benefit a systematic exposition of the teaching that
involves a comparison with oneself.

_Attūpanāyikaṃ vo gahapatayo dhammapariyāyaṃ desissāmī ti_

What is the systematic exposition of the teaching that involves a comparison
with oneself?

_Katamo ca gahapatayo attūpanāyiko dhammapariyāyo:_

In this regard, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: 'I am one who
wishes to live, who does not wish to die; I desire happiness and loathe pain.
Since I am one who wishes to live... and loathe pain, if someone were to take
my life, that would not be agreeable and pleasing to me.

_idha gahapatayo ariyasāvako iti paṭisañcikkhati ahaṃ khosmi jīvitukāmo
amaritukāmo sukhakāmo dukkhapaṭikkūlo. Yo kho maṃ jīvitukāmaṃ
amaritukāmaṃ sukhakāmaṃ dukkhapaṭikkūlaṃ jīvitā voropeyya na me
taṃ assa piyaṃ manāpaṃ_

Now if I were to take the life of another -- of one who wishes to live, who
does not wish to die, who desires happiness and loathes pain -- that would not
be agreeable and pleasing to the other either. What is disagreeable and
displeasing to me is disagreeable and displeasing to the other too. How can I
inflict upon another what is disagreeable and displeasing to me?'

_ahañceva kho pana paraṃ jīvitukāmaṃ. Sukhakāmaṃ
dukkhapaṭikkūlaṃ jīvitā voropeyya parassapi taṃ assa appiyaṃ
amanāpaṃ. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo. Parassapeso dhammo appiyo
amanāpo. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo kathāhaṃ paraṃ tena
saṃyojeyyanti_

In reflecting thus, he himself abstains from killing, exhorts others to abstain
from killing, and speaks in praise of abstaining from killing.

_So iti paṭisaṅkhāya attanā ca pāṇātipātā paṭivirato hoti.
Parañca pāṇātipātā veramaṇiyā samādapeti. Pāṇātipātā

Then, remaining in the highest state of refined awareness it occurs to him,
'Intentionality is worse for me, being free of intentionality is better.

_Tassa saññagge ṭhitassa evaṃ hoti cetayamānassa me pāpiyo

If I were to be intent upon or to aim [at anything further], these states of
refined awareness that I have attained would cease and less refined states of
refined awareness would arise in me.

_Ahañceva kho pana ceteyyaṃ abhisaṅkhareyyaṃ imā ca me saññā

How about if I were not to be intent upon or to aim [at anything further]?'

_Yannūnāhaṃ na ceva ceteyyaṃ na cābhisaṅkhareyyan ti._

So he is neither intent [upon anything], nor aims [at anything further].

_So na ceva ceteti na cābhisaṅkharoti._

And thus in him just these states of refined awareness cease, and other less
refined states of refined awareness do not arise.

_Tassa acetayato anabhisaṅkharoto tā ceva saññā nirujjhanti aññā ca
oḷārikā saññā na uppajjanti._

He attains to the ending [of originated phenomena].

_So nirodhaṃ phusati._

==== Introduction

===== Inward darkness

Inward darkness (either _tama_ or _kaṇha_) connotes all spiritually
unwholesome states. For example, Māra's tenfold army is called 'the forces of
inward darkness' (_kaṇhassābhippahārinī_, Sn.v.439):

[quote, Sn.v.436-439]
____
Sensuous pleasure is your first army. Disgruntlement [with the celibate life],
your second. Third is hunger and thirst. The fourth is called craving. Lethargy
and torpor are your fifth. The sixth is called fear. Your seventh is doubt
[about the significance of abandoning spiritually unwholesome factors and
undertaking spiritually wholesome factors]. Denigration and obstinacy are your
eighth. Gain, renown, honour, and ill-gotten prestige [are your ninth].
Extolling oneself and despising others, [considering them inferior due to
conceit, is your tenth]. That is your army, Namuci, the forces of inward
darkness. None but the heroic will conquer it. Having conquered it one finds
happiness.

_Kāmā te paṭhamā senā dutiyā arati vuccati +
Tatiyā khuppipāsā te catutthī taṇhā pavuccati +
Pañcamaṃ thīnamiddhaṃ te chaṭṭhā bhīru pavuccati +

Yo cattānaṃ samukkaṃse pare ca avajānati +
Esā namuci te senā kaṇhassābhippahārinī +
Na naṃ asūro jināti jetvā ca labhate sukhaṃ._
____

Sometimes individual factors are singled out as factors of inward darkness. For
example, 1) craving 2) mental impurity 3) passionate attachment:

1. He destroyed craving for denomination-and-bodily-form in this world, the
stream of inward darkness which had long been lurking in him.'
+
****
_Acchecchi taṇhaṃ idha nāmarūpe kaṇhassa sotaṃ
dīgharattānusayitaṃ_ (Sn.v.355).
****

2. When he is conscious of a state of mental impurity he should dispel it with
the thought: "It is part of inward darkness."
+
****
_Yadāvilattaṃ manaso vijaññā kaṇhassa pakkho ti vinodayeyya_ (Sn.v.967).
****

3. Those who are full of passionate attachment, enveloped in a mass of inward
darkness, will never see [the nature of reality] which is obscure, deep, hard
to discern, subtle, going against the stream.
+
****
_Paṭisotagāmiṃ nipuṇaṃ gambhīraṃ duddasaṃ aṇuṃ +
****
Rāgarattā na dakkhinti tamokkhandhena āvutāti_ (S.1.137).

However, that inward darkness equals the _āsavas_ is most clearly seen from
this quote:

[quote, Th.v.627]
____
In the first watch of the night I recalled my previous births. In the middle
watch of the night I purified my divine vision. In the last watch of the night
I obliterated the mass of inward darkness.

_Rattiyā paṭhamaṃ yāmaṃ pubbajātimanussariṃ +
Rattiyā majjhimaṃ yāmaṃ dibbacakkhuṃ visodhayiṃ +
Rattiyā pacchime yāme tamokkhandhaṃ padālayiṃ._
____

This quote should be compared to the Buddha's enlightenment where inward
darkness is replaced by the three _āsavas_:

[quote, Vin.3.3-4]
____
I directed my mind to the knowledge through recalling of past lives;

_pubbenivāsānussatiñāṇāya cittaṃ abhininnāmesiṃ._

(...) I recalled my manifold former lives with their aspects and particulars.

_Iti sākāraṃ sauddesaṃ anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarāmi._

This was the first final knowledge attained by me in the first watch of the night;

_Ayaṃ kho me brāhmaṇa rattiyā paṭhame yāme paṭhamā vijjā adhigatā_

I directed my mind towards the knowledge of the transmigration of beings

_sattānaṃ cutūpapātañāṇāya cittaṃ abhininnāmesiṃ._

(...) Thus with purified divine vision surpassing that of men, I saw beings
passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, well-favoured and
ill-favoured, fortunate and unfortunate, and discerned how beings fare
according to their deeds.

_Iti dibbena cakkhunā visuddhena atikkantamānusakena satte passāmi cavamāne
uppajjamāne hīne paṇīte suvaṇṇe dubbaṇṇe sugate duggate
yathākammūpage satte pajānāmi._

This was the second final knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of the
night.

_Ayaṃ kho me brāhmaṇa rattiyā majjhime yāme dutiyā vijjā adhigatā_

I directed my mind towards the knowledge of the destruction of perceptually
obscuring states.

_āsavānaṃ khayañāṇāya cittaṃ abhininnāmesiṃ._

(...) thus knowing, thus seeing, my mind was freed from the three
perceptually obscuring states.

_Tassa me evaṃ jānato evaṃ passato kāmāsavā pi cittaṃ vimuccittha.
Bhavāsavā pi cittaṃ vimuccittha. Avijjāsavā pi cittaṃ vimuccittha._

With release, there was the knowledge I was released. I knew that birth was
destroyed. The religious life has been fulfilled. What had to be done has been
done. There will be no further arising in any state of individual existence

_Vimuttasmiṃ vimuttami ti ñāṇaṃ ahosi. Khīṇā jāti vusitaṃ
brahmacariyaṃ kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ nāparaṃ itthattāyāti
abbhaññāsiṃ._

This was, brahman, the third final knowledge attained by me in the last watch
of the night.

_Ayaṃ kho me brāhmaṇa rattiyā pacchime yāme tatiyā vijjā adhigatā._

Lethargy and torpor are your fifth. The sixth is called fear. Your seventh is
doubt [about the significance of abandoning spiritually unwholesome factors and
undertaking spiritually wholesome factors]. Denigration and obstinacy are your
eighth.

Gain, renown, honour, and ill-gotten prestige [are your ninth]. Extolling
oneself and despising others, [considering them inferior due to conceit, is
your tenth].

That is your army, Namuci, the forces of inward darkness. None but the heroic
will conquer it. Having conquered it one finds happiness.

=== Kappa

==== Renderings

- _kappa_: one hundred years

- _kappa_: a universal cycle

- _kappa_: the period of a universal cycle

- _saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭakappa_: the period of a universal cycle

==== Introduction

===== The period of a universal cycle

The period of a universal cycle (_kappa_) is long (_dīgho kho bhikkhu kappo_
S.2.181). If a square city had sides 10 kilometres long, and walls 10
kilometres high, and was filled with mustard seeds, and a man removed one seed
every hundred years, he would have removed all the seeds, but the universal
cycle would still be unfinished (S.2.182).

The maths is easily totted. If a mustard seed is a cubic millimetre, then the
seeds would be emptied in 10,000 million million years.

===== Living for a kappa

But perplexingly, the Buddha said that by developing the four paths to psychic
power (_cattāro iddhipādā_), if one wished one could live for a _kappa_ or
slightly more than a _kappa_ (_kappaṃ vā tiṭṭheyya kappāvasesaṃ vā_
S.5.259). He said he could do the same himself (D.2.103). But is this the same
_kappa_? Could an arahant live for billions of years?

===== The problem of co-existing Buddhas

Some, amazingly, say yes, he can. But there are problems with this. Firstly,
there can never simultaneously be two Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas in the
world (_yaṃ ekissā lokadhātuyā dve arahanto sammāsambuddho apubbaṃ
acarimaṃ uppajjeyyuṃ netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjatī ti_, M.3.65). And if
these Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas lived for the period of a universal cycle,
their lives would overlap, which would break this law. The births of recent
Buddhas are as follows:

- Buddha Vipassī: 91 kappas ago

- Buddha Sikhī and Buddha Vessabhū: 31 kappas ago

- Buddha Kakusandha, Buddha Konāgamana, Buddha Kassapa and Buddha Gotama arose
in this present 'fortunate kappa' (_bhaddakappe_), and Buddha Metteyya is
expected here, too (D.2.2; BDPPN).

Thus, with up to five Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas in one _kappa_, with each
Buddha capable of living one _kappa_, but unable to co-exist with other
Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas, it would only be possible if _kappa_ had more
than one meaning, with one _kappa_ being much shorter, at most a fifth of the
other.

===== Venerable MahāKassapa: less than 220 years old

In more recent times, consider Venerable MahāKassapa. He was 120 years old at
the First Council (BDPPN), and some even claim he is still alive today,
dwelling in the Kukkutagiri Mountains, wrapt in samādhi, awaiting the arrival
of Metteyya Buddha (BDPPN). According to this he is therefore now approximately
2,600 years old. But at the Second Council, 100 years after the First Council,
the oldest bhikkhu on earth (_paṭhavyā saṅghatthero_, Vin.2.303) was
Venerable Sabbakāma. Therefore Kassapa must have passed away before his
220^th^ birthday. But 220 is too generous, because by the laws of normal
distribution, Sabbakāma must have been marking the end of the bell curve. And
as, at the Second Council, he had been in robes for 120 years, and if we can
assume he ordained at aged 20 after leaving his wife (Th.v.453), then it would
seem that the absolute end of the bell curve would not be many hours or minutes
beyond 140, and that 140 is therefore as old as a bhikkhu can possibly get.

===== Kappa: length is not fixed

The _Mahāpadāna Sutta_ (D.2.3) says human lifespan (_āyuppamāṇaṃ_) has
varied considerably in the times of previous Perfectly Enlightened Buddhas, as
follows:

[quote, D.2.53]
____
Buddha Vipassī: 80,000 years.

_asīti vassasahassāni āyuppamāṇaṃ ahosi_
____

- Buddha Sikhī: 70,000 years

- Buddha Vessabhū: 60,000 years

- Buddha Kakusandhu: 40,000 years

- Buddha Konāgamana: 30,000 years

- Buddha Kassapa: 20,000 years

- Buddha Gotama: 100 years.

The _Mahāpadāna Sutta_ (D.2.11) gives further details of Buddha Vipassī:

____
He was born of the _khattiya_ race in a _khattiya_ family

_Vipassī bhikkhave bhagavā arahaṃ sammāsambuddho khattiyo jātiyā ahosi
khattiyakule udapādi_

He lived for 80,000 years

_Vipassissa bhikkhave bhagavato arahato sammāsambuddhassa
asītivassasahassāni āyuppamāṇaṃ ahosi_
____

Thus Buddha Vipassī lived for the lifespan of his era. And because his own
lifespan and the human lifespan correspond, and because Buddhas can live for a
_kappa_, it suggests that _kappa_ means the human lifespan, and that all the
figures for human lifespans given in the list above can be read as _kappas_. So
the length of this kind of _kappa_ diminishes over time. Therefore _kappa_ in
our present era means 'a century'.

===== Universal cycle: four incalculable phases

Now we will examine the other meanings of _kappa_: 'universal cycle' and
'period of a universal cycle.' We have already explained the timespan of the
universal cycle. These cycles have four incalculable phases (_cattāri kappassa
asaṅkheyyānī_):

1. a period when the universal cycle is in its contracting phase
+
****
_yadā kappo saṃvaṭṭati_
****

2. a period when the universal cycle is in its stationary contracted phase
+
****
_yadā kappo saṃvaṭṭo tiṭṭhati_
****

3. a period when the universal cycle is in its expanding phase
+
****
_yadā kappo vivaṭṭati_
****

4. a period when the universal cycle is in its stationary expanded phase
+
****
_yadā kappo vivaṭṭo tiṭṭhati_ (A.2.142).
****

These cycles of expansion and contraction affect the heavenly realms, too, up
to and including the world of Brahmā (D.1.15). With the contraction phase, the
world of Brahmā disappears, and residents there must move temporarily into the
Ābhassarā world.

===== Universal cycles: incalculable number of sand grains

How many of these universal cycles have there ever been? There have been so
many, that the Buddha likened them to the numbers of sand grains between 'the
point where the river Ganges originates and the point where it enters the great
ocean' (S.2.183-4). And if we remember that each sand grain represents billions
of centuries, that is a very long time indeed.

===== Recalling previous lives

When ascetics and Brahmanists recall previous lives, the _Brahmajāla Sutta_
says they fall into three groups:

____
those who remember up to several hundred thousand lifetimes

_anekāni pi jātisatasahassāni_

those who recall [past lives in the last] 10 universal cycles

_dasa pi saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭāni_

those who recall [past lives in the last] 40 universal cycles

_cattārīsampi saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭāni_
____

These feats of memory are extraordinary, but nothing compared to Venerable
Sobhita, called the 'chief of disciples who could recall past lives' (A.1.25).
In the course of one night he was able to recall [past lives in the last] 500
universal cycles (_pañcakappasatānāhaṃ ekarattiṃ anussarinti_,
Th.v.165-6). Anuruddha could remember further, but may have needed more nights:

[quote, S.5.303]
____
It is because I have developed and cultivated these four bases of mindfulness
that I recall [past lives in the last] 1,000 universal cycles.

_Imesañca panāhaṃ āvuso catunnaṃ satipaṭṭhānānaṃ bhāvitattā
bahulīkatattā kappasahassaṃ anussarāmīti._
____

But that merely 1,000 sand grains in the 2500 kilometres of the River Ganges.
The Buddha's ability was unlimited. His usual ability during conversations was
91 universal cycles (M.1.483; S.4.325):

[quote, M.1.483]
____
When I recollect the past ninety-one universal cycles, Vaccha, I do not recall
any Ājīvaka ascetic who went to heaven.

_Ito kho so vaccha ekanavuto kappo yamahaṃ anussarāmi nābhijānāmi kañci
ājīvakaṃ saggūpagaṃ._
____

[quote, S.4.324]
____
When I recollect the past ninety-one universal cycles, headman, I do not recall
any family being destroyed merely by giving cooked almsfood.

_Ito so gāmaṇi ekanavuto kappo yamahaṃ anussarāmi nābhijānāmi
kiñcikulaṃ pakkabhikkhāanuppadānamattena upahatapubbaṃ._
____

But at full stretch he could recall hundreds of thousands of universal cycles.
In fact, as far as he liked (_so yāvatakaṃ ākaṅkhati tāvatakaṃ
anussarati_, D.3.134). Thus he could legitimately proclaim:

[quote, S.2.181-2]
____
So long is the period of a universal cycle, bhikkhu. And of universal cycles of
such length, we have wandered the round of birth and death for the periods of
so many universal cycles, so many hundreds of universal cycles, so many
thousands of universal cycles, so many hundreds of thousands of universal
cycles.

_Evaṃ dīgho kho bhikkhu kappo. Evaṃ dīghānaṃ kho bhikkhu kappānaṃ
neko kappo saṃsito nekaṃ kappasataṃ saṃsitaṃ nekaṃ kappasahassaṃ
saṃsitaṃ nekaṃ kappasatasahassaṃ saṃsitaṃ._
____

===== Recollecting kappas of contraction and expansion: centuries

When bhikkhus recall their previous lives, they describe it as follows:

[quote, S.2.214]
____
'I recall my manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two lifetimes, three
lifetimes... a hundred lifetimes, a thousand lifetimes, a hundred thousand
lifetimes, [past lives in the last] many _kappas_ of contraction, many _kappas_
of expansion, many _kappas_ of contraction and expansion.

_aneke pi saṃvaṭṭakappe aneke pi vivaṭṭakappe aneke pi
saṃvaṭṭavivaṭṭakappe._
____

Because _kappa_ is part of the contraction and expansion phases of the
universal cycle, in this context it must mean 'century':

- '... many centuries of the universal cycle's contraction phase, many
centuries of the universal cycle's expansion phase... .'

=== Kappaṃ n'eti

==== Renderings

- _kappaṃ n'eti_: he is not caught up in egocentric conception

==== Introduction

===== Kappaṃ n'eti: Sn.v.521, Sn.v.535, and Sn.v.860

_Kappaṃ n'eti_ occurs thrice in the scriptures: Sn.v.521, Sn.v.535, and
Sn.v.860. _Kappaṃ_ occurs with the same meaning a further five times at
Sn.v.373, Sn.v.517, Sn.v.911, Sn.v.914, and Sn.v.1101, but these do not much
help with the meaning of _kappaṃ n'eti_:

[quote, Sn.v.914]
____
He is not caught up in egocentric conception.

_na kappiyo._
____

[quote, Sn.v.1101]
____
The one who has abandoned egocentric conception

_Kappaṃ jahaṃ._
____

In Sn.v.911 _kappaṃ_ is almost synonymous with _saṅkhā_:

[quote, Sn.v.911]
____
The Brahman is beyond the limits of conception and egocentric conception.

_Na brāhmaṇo kappamupeti saṅkhā._
____

Sn.v.373 and Sn.v.517 are in the illustrations.

===== Kappa: meaning

_Kappa_ means 'a (false) supposition, imagining; a theory; a figment,' says
DOP. These words concur with our rendering, except for being countable nouns.

PED says _kappa_ means 'anything made with a definite object in view, prepared,
arranged,' and says that 'as a cycle of time = _saṃsāra_ at Sn 521, 535,
860,' which is wrong.

===== Eti: meaning

_Eti_ means:

- 'to go, go to, reach' (PED).

- 'goes; goes towards; reaches, obtains; reaches (a state); is involved (in)' (DOP).

===== Norman: come to/submit to figments

Norman translates the three references as follows:

[quote, Sn.v.521]
____
He comes to no figment among devas and men who are subject to figments.

_Devamanussesu kappiyesu kappaṃ n'eti._
____

[quote, Sn.v.535]
____
Having thrust away the triple perception, the mud, he does not come to figments.

_Saññaṃ tividhaṃ panujja paṅkaṃ kappaṃ n'eti._
____

[quote, Sn.v.860]
____
He does not submit to figments, being without figments.

_kappaṃ n'eti akappiyo._
____

Norman does not always follow the singular cases, for which an uncountable noun
would be suitable.

===== Sn.v.860: not caught up in egocentric conception

In Sn.v.860 _kappaṃ n'eti_ is associated with not comparing oneself with
others:

[quote, Sn.v.860]
____
The sage, free of greed and stinginess, does not proclaim himself as being
amongst the superior, equal, or inferior. He is not caught up in egocentric
conception. He is free of egocentric conception.

_Vītagedho amaccharī na ussesu vadate muni +
Na samesu na omesu kappaṃ n'eti akappiyo._
____

===== Sn.v.535: the three modes [of self-centredness] abandoned

In Sn.v.535 _kappaṃ n'eti_ is associated with abandoning the three modes of
self-centredness:

[quote, Sn.v.535]
____
One who has thrust away the three grubby modes of perception, and who is not
caught up in egocentric conception: they call him 'noble.'

_Saññaṃ tividhaṃ panujja paṅkaṃ kappaṃ n'eti tamāhu ariyo ti._
____

Because Sn.v.860 (in paragraph above) involves comparison of oneself with
others, we regard _saññaṃ tividhaṃ... paṅkaṃ_ ('the three grubby
modes of perception') in Sn.v.535 as likewise implying comparison of oneself
with others, and therefore meaning _tisso vidhā_ ('the three modes [of
self-centredness]'). The three modes of self-centredness are:

[quote, S.5.56]
____
'I am better' mode [of self-centredness]

_seyyo'hamasmī ti vidhā_

'I am equal' mode [of self-centredness]

_sadiso'hamasmī ti vidhā_

'I am worse' mode [of self-centredness]

_hīno'hamasmī ti vidhā._
____

===== Sn.v.521

Sn.v.521 is illustrated below.

===== Conclusion

_Kappaṃ n'eti_ is associated with terms that imply arahantship:

1. Not comparing oneself with others

2. Thrusting away the three modes of self-centredness

Although _kappaṃ_ is close in meaning to the widely supported 'figment,' this
term is problematic for two reasons:

1. Firstly, our findings show that the specific figment involved is 'egocentric conception.'

2. Secondly, egocentric conception is an uncountable noun, and therefore better
than 'figment' because pluralising is then unnecessary.

here.

=== Kamma

==== Renderings

- _kamma_: conduct

- _kamma_: deed

- _kamma_: accumulated merit

- _kamma_: accumulated demerit

- _kamma_: karmically consequential conduct

- _kamma_: the operation of the karmic mechanism

- _kamma_: legal act of an assembly of bhikkhus

- _kaṇhakamma_: accumulated demerit

- _pāpakamma_: accumulated demerit

==== Introduction

===== Kamma: conduct

_Kamma_ often means 'conduct' or 'deed'. For example:

[quote, A.2.69-70]
____
A noble disciple is endowed with blameless bodily conduct.

_anavajjena kāyakammena samannāgato hoti._
____

[quote, Sn.v.230-232]
____
Although he may do an unvirtuous deed by body, speech, or mind, he is incapable
of hiding it.

_Kiñcāpi so kammaṃ karoti pāpakaṃ kāyena vācā uda cetasā vā +
Abhabbo so tassa paṭicchādāya._
____

===== Kamma: the operation of the karmic mechanism

_Kamma_ can mean 'the operation of the karmic mechanism,' called _kammayanta_
at quotes below, Th.v.574 and Th.v.419.

[quote, A.3.206]
____
He is superstitious. He believes in luck, not in the operation of the karmic
mechanism.

_kotuhalamaṅgaliko hoti maṅgalaṃ pacceti no kammaṃ_

He is not superstitious. He believes in the operation of the karmic mechanism,
not in luck.

_akotuhalamaṅgaliko hoti kammaṃ pacceti no maṅgalaṃ._
____

Because merit and demerit is accumulated, it means that all but arahants are
caught in the operation of the karmic mechanism:

[quote, Th.v.574]
____
Thus does [one who is attached to] the [human] body take his course, driven by
the operation of the karmic mechanism

_Evāyaṃ vattate kāyo kammayantena yantito._
____

[quote, Th.v.419]
____
By destroying the origin of ignorance [of things according to reality], [the
eightfold path, _ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo_, Th.v.421] is a destroyer of the
operation of the karmic mechanism.

_Aññāṇamūlabhedāya kammayantavighāṭano._
____

PED (sv _yanta_) for _kammayanta_ (Th.v.419) gives 'the machinery of Kamma,'
and (sv _yantita_) renders _kammayantena_ (Th.v.574) as 'impelled by the
machinery of Karma.'

===== Kamma: the field

_Kamma_ is sometimes called 'the field,' which we take to mean 'the [field of]
operation of the karmic mechanism':

- Thus Ānanda,

[quote, A.1.223-4]
____
(...) the [field of] operation of the karmic mechanism is the field.

_kammaṃ khettaṃ_

(...) the stream of sense consciousness, the seed.

_viññāṇaṃ bījaṃ_

(...) craving, the moisture.

_taṇhā sneho._

(...) For beings [obstructed by] uninsightfulness into reality, and [tethered to
individual existence] by craving.

_avijjānīvaraṇānaṃ sattānaṃ taṇhāsaṃyojanānaṃ_

(...) the stream of sense consciousness is established in the low plane of
existence.

_hīnāya dhātuyā viññāṇaṃ patiṭṭhitaṃ_

(...) In this way renewed states of individual existence and rebirth occur in the
future.

_evaṃ āyatiṃ punabbhavābhinibbatti hoti._
____

===== English word karma

Karma means:

- the principle of retributive justice determining a person's state of life and
the state of his reincarnations as the effect of his past deeds

- the doctrine of inevitable consequence

- destiny or fate (Collins Dictionary).

We therefore avoid using the term because of the connotations of fatalism or
fate. Nonetheless, we use 'karmic'.

===== Merit and demerit: upacita

Where kamma is 'accumulated' (_upacita_) it stands for merit or demerit. For
example:

[quote, Vin.2.193]
____
This is the first time that demerit whose consequence comes without delay has
been accumulated by Devadatta.

_idaṃ bhikkhave devadattena paṭhamaṃ ānantariyakammaṃ upacitaṃ._
____

[quote, D.2.136]
____
Venerable Cunda the metalworker has accumulated merit that is conducive to long
life

_Āyusaṃvattanikaṃ āyasmatā cundena kammāraputtena kammaṃ upacitaṃ._
____

===== The arahant: no further karmically consequential conduct

The arahant does not undertake karmically consequential deeds:

____
-- What do you think, bhikkhus: can a bhikkhu whose _āsavas_ are destroyed
(_khīṇāsavo bhikkhu_) undertake a karmically consequential deed that is
meritorious, demeritorious, or karmically neutral?

_puññābhisaṅkhāraṃ vā abhisaṅkhareyya apuññābhisaṅkhāraṃ vā
abhisaṅkhareyya āneñjābhisaṅkhāraṃ vā abhisaṅkhareyyā ti_
____

-- No, bhante (S.2.83).

===== The arahant: destruction of merit and demerit

The scriptures sometimes suggest the arahant has destroyed all merit and
demerit. For example:

[quote, Th.v.80]
____
Whatever karmically consequential conduct was undertaken by me, whether small
or great, all that [accumulated merit and demerit] is exhausted.

_Yaṃ mayā pakataṃ kammaṃ appaṃ vā yadi vā bahuṃ; +
Sabbametaṃ parikkhīṇaṃ._
____

[quote, M.2.105]
____
While I undertook much karmically consequential conduct of the kind which leads
to [rebirth in] the plane of misery, yet its karmic consequence has reached me
now. I enjoy my food free of karmic debt.

_Tādisaṃ kammaṃ katvāna bahuṃ duggatigāminaṃ; +
Phuṭṭho kammavipākena anaṇo bhuñjāmi bhojanaṃ._
____

Yet the scriptures also unequivocably say the opposite, that till the time of
their death arahants continue to receive the karmic consequences of previous
karmically consequential conduct:

[quote, A.3.414]
____
The bhikkhu... who is free of perceptually obscuring states... undertakes no
new karmically consequential conduct and nullifies previous karmically
consequential conduct by the gradual experience [of its consequences].

_bhikkhu... anāsavaṃ... so navañca kammaṃ na karoti purāṇañca
kammaṃ phussa phussa vyantīkaroti._
____

[quote, S.2.64-5]
____
And the body, too, is to be regarded as the consequences of previous karmically
consequential conduct, even for arahants.

_kāyo... purāṇamidaṃ bhikkhave kammaṃ... daṭṭhabbaṃ._
____

Therefore when the scriptures say arahants have exhausted their merit and
demerit, it either means:

1. that they will have done so by the time of their final passing, or

2. that when accumulated merit and demerit is exhausted, there still remains
the consequences of that merit and demerit.

===== The non-returner and demerit

A non-returner receives within his very lifetime all unpleasant karmic
consequences of past conduct:

[quote, A.5.300]
____
Whatever demeritorious karmically consequential conduct was previously
undertaken by this [wretched human] body born of deeds, all [the consequences
of] that must be experienced now [in this lifetime]; it will not [be able to]
arise hereafter.' Thus developed, the liberation [from perceptually obscuring
states] through [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill leads to
non-returnership for a wise bhikkhu here who has not penetrated to a more
exalted liberation.

_yaṃ kho me idha kiñcī pubbe iminā karajakāyena pāpakammaṃ kataṃ
sabbaṃ taṃ idha vedanīyaṃ na taṃ anugaṃ bhavissatī ti. Evaṃ
bhāvitā kho bhikkhave mettācetovimutti anāgāmitāya saṃvattati idha
paññassa bhikkhuno uttariṃ vimuttiṃ appaṭivijjhato._
____

A non-returner is therefore left to receive after death only pleasant karmic
consequences.

===== Nullifying karmically consequential deeds

Karmically consequential deeds are nullified by experiencing their karmic
consequence, a process described in these quotes:

[quote, A.5.292]
____
'I declare that there can be no nullification of karmically consequential deeds
which have been intentionally undertaken and karmically accumulated without
experiencing [their karmic consequences], either in this life, or on rebirth,
or in some other subsequent [existence].'

_Nāhaṃ bhikkhave sañcetanikānaṃ kammānaṃ katānaṃ upacitānaṃ
appaṭisaṃviditvā vyantībhāvaṃ vadāmi. Tañca kho diṭṭhe vā
dhamme upapajje vā apare vā pariyāye._
____

[quote, A.2.198]
____
Previous karmically consequential conduct is nullified by the gradual
experience [of its consequences]

_purāṇañca kammaṃ phussa phussa vyantīkaroti._
____

===== The four types of deeds

There are four types of deeds. The first three types are:

- dark (_kammaṃ kaṇhaṃ_)

- bright (_kammaṃ sukkaṃ_),

- dark-and-bright (_kammaṃ kaṇhasukkaṃ_) (M.1.389).

Here, 'dark' means 'a hostile karmically consequential deed' (_savyāpajjhaṃ
kāyasaṅkhāraṃ... vacīsaṅkhāraṃ... manosaṅkhāraṃ
abhisaṅkharoti_, M.1.391) and 'bright' means 'an unhostile karmically
consequential deed' (_avyāpajjhaṃ_ M.1.391).

The karmic consequences of such deeds are also dark, bright, or dark-and-bright
(_kaṇhavipākaṃ sukkavipākaṃ kaṇhasukkavipākaṃ_) where 'dark' means
hostile sense impression (_savyāpajjhaṃ vedanaṃ_ M.1.389) and 'bright'
means unhostile sense impression (_avyāpajjhaṃ vedanaṃ_ M.1.390).

For those wishing to escape karmically consequential conduct there is a fourth
type of deed called 'neither-dark-nor-bright' (_kammaṃ akaṇhaṃ
asukkaṃ_) which leads to the destruction of karmically consequential conduct
(_kammakkhayāya saṃvattati_). This deed involves

1. The intentionality to abandon karmically consequential conduct that is dark
with dark karmic consequences
+
****
_yamidaṃ kammaṃ kaṇhaṃ kaṇhavipākaṃ tassa pahānāya yā cetanā_
****

2. The intentionality to abandon karmically consequential conduct that is
bright with bright karmic consequences

****
_yampidaṃ kammaṃ sukkaṃ sukkavipākaṃ tassa pahānāya yā cetanā_

3. The intentionality to abandon karmically consequential conduct that is

_yampidaṃ kammaṃ kaṇhasukkaṃ kaṇhasukkavipākaṃ tassa pahānāya

[quote, M.1.391]
____
This is called conduct that is neither-dark-nor-bright with
neither-dark-nor-bright karmic consequences that leads to the destruction of
karmically consequential conduct.

_idaṃ vuccati puṇṇa kammaṃ akaṇhaṃ asukkaṃ
akaṇhāsukkavipākaṃ kammakkhayāya saṃvattati._
____

The seven enlightenment factors are such conduct (_kammaṃ kammakkhayāya
saṃvattati,_ A.2.237). So is the eightfold path (_sammādiṭṭhi...
sammāsamādhī,_ A.2.237).

===== On making the suttas incomprehensible

The sutta we have just quoted can be made incomprehensible, if, instead of
saying one should abandon karmically consequential conduct, the sutta is
rendered to say that one should 'abandon all conduct, whether dark or bright.'
This would contradict much of the Buddha's teaching, which constantly praises
the cultivation of good conduct:

[quote, Dh.v.183]
____
The refraining from everything unvirtuous; the undertaking of what is
spiritually wholesome... this is the training system of the Buddhas.

_sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṃ kusalassa upasampadā... etaṃ buddhānaṃ sāsanaṃ._
____

[quote, It.14-16]
____
Do not be afraid of acts of merit. This is called pleasant, desirable,
likeable, agreeable, and pleasing, namely meritorious deeds

_Mā bhikkhave puññānaṃ bhāyittha sukhassetaṃ bhikkhave adivacanaṃ
iṭṭhassa kantassa piyassa manāpassa yadidaṃ puññāni._
____

===== Merit is not obstructive

Although non-greed, non-hatred, and discernment of reality are bases for the
arising of [meritorious] deeds (_alobho... adoso... amoho nidānaṃ
kammānaṃ samudayāya_), when greed, hatred, and undiscernment of reality
disappear, that merit is abandoned (_lobhe... dose... mohe vigate evaṃ taṃ
kammaṃ pahīṇaṃ hoti_, A.1.134-5). If it was not abandoned, then merit
would prevent one's final liberation, because:

[quote, A.5.292]
____
I declare that there is no putting an end to suffering without experiencing the
consequences of karmically consequential deeds which have been intentionally
undertaken and karmically accumulated.

_Na tvevāhaṃ bhikkhave sañcetanikānaṃ kammānaṃ katānaṃ
upacitānaṃ appaṭisaṃviditvā dukkhassantakiriyaṃ vadāmi._
____

===== Kamma in disciplinary procedures

In the context of discipline, _kamma_ means 'legal act of an assembly of
bhikkhus.'

Stealing is threefold, I declare: due to greed, hatred, and undiscernment of

_Adinnādānampahaṃ bhikkhave kividhaṃ vadāmi lobhahetukampi dosahetukampi

Thus greed is a basis for the arising of karmically consequential deeds;
likewise hatred and undiscernment of reality.

_Iti kho bhikkhave lobho kammanidānasambhavo doso kammanidānasambhavo moho
kammanidānasambhavo._

The destruction of greed, hatred, and undiscernment of reality each produces
the destruction of a basis of karmically consequential deeds.

There are three bases for the arising of karmically consequential deeds. What
three?

_Tīṇi'māni bhikkhave nidānāni kammānaṃ samudayāya. Katamāni tīṇi:_

Greed is a basis for the origination of karmically consequential deeds.

_lobho nidānaṃ kammānaṃ samudayāya_

Hatred is a basis for the origination of karmically consequential deeds.

_doso nidānaṃ kammānaṃ samudayāya_

Undiscernment of reality is a basis for the origination of karmically
consequential deeds.

_moho nidānaṃ kammānaṃ samudayāya._

Karmically consequential conduct produced from greed, born of greed, due to
greed, originated by greed bears fruit wherever the rebirth of one's
individuality occurs.

_Yaṃ bhikkhave lobhapakataṃ... mohapakataṃ kammaṃ mohajaṃ
mohanidānaṃ mohasamudayaṃ yatthassa attabhāvo nibbattati tattha taṃ
kammaṃ vipaccati.._

Wherever that karmically consequential conduct bears fruit, there one
experiences the karmic consequences of one's conduct, either in this life, or
on rebirth, or in some other subsequent [existence].

_Yattha taṃ kammaṃ vipaccati tattha tassa kammassa vipākaṃ
paṭisaṃvedeti diṭṭhe vā dhamme upapajje vā apare vā pariyāye._

There are three bases for the arising of karmically consequential deeds

_Tīṇi'māni bhikkhave nidānāni kammānaṃ samudayāya. Katamāni tīṇi:_

Non-greed is a basis for the origination of karmically consequential deeds.

_alobho nidānaṃ kammānaṃ samudayāya_

Non-hatred is a basis for the origination of karmically consequential deeds.

_adoso nidānaṃ kammānaṃ samudayāya_

Penetrative discernment is a basis for the origination of karmically
consequential deeds.

_amoho nidānaṃ kammānaṃ samudayāya_

But with the disappearance of greed, hatred, and undiscernment of reality, that
accumulated merit is abandoned.

_lobhe... dose... mohe vigate evaṃ taṃ kammaṃ pahīṇaṃ hoti_

It is chopped down at the root, completely and irreversibly destroyed, never to
arise again in future.

_Yaṃ bhikkhave alobhapakataṃ kammaṃ alobhajaṃ alobhanidānaṃ
alobhasamudayaṃ lobhe vigate... dose vigate... mohe vigate evaṃ taṃ

Comment:

If the merit of good conduct was not automatically abandoned in this way, then
doing good deeds would block one's final liberation because one is obliged to
receive the karmic consequences of all conduct.

==== Introduction

===== [Unlimited, all-encompassing] compassion

The practices of _mettā_, _karuṇā_, _muditā_ and _upekkhā_ are sometimes
called the four divine abidings (_cattāro brahmavihārā_, D.2.196) and
sometimes the four unlimited states (_catasso appamaññā_, D.3.223).
Practising them together is called the 'unlimited liberation [from perceptually
obscuring states]' (_appamāṇā cetovimutti_, S.4.296). The _Mahāvedalla
Sutta_ (M.1.298) and _Godatta Sutta_ (S.4.296) say the 'makers of limitation'
(_pamāṇakaraṇo_) are _rāgo doso_ and _moho_ (_rāgo kho āvuso
pamāṇakaraṇo doso pamāṇakaraṇo moho pamāṇakaraṇo_). Therefore
the four _brahmavihāras_ should be practised unlimited by _rāgo doso_ and
_moho_. And therefore we call _karuṇā_ '[unlimited, all-encompassing]
compassion':

[quote, S.4.296]
____
In this regard a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind of
[unlimited, all-encompassing] compassion, likewise the second quarter, the
third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, in all
directions, everywhere, he abides pervading the whole world [of beings] with a

There are these three kinds of spiritually unwholesome thinking

thinking concerned with not wanting to be despised

thinking concerned with gains, honour, and renown

_lābhasakkārasilokapaṭisaṃyutto vitakko_

thinking concerned with feeling sorry for others

Comment:

As an example of feeling sorry for others, consider Nissaggiyā Pācittiyā
Rule 22 which says that if a bhikkhu wrongfully gets himself a new bowl from a
lay supporter, that bowl should be forfeited to the group of bhikkhus. The bowl
should be first offered to the senior bhikkhu, who should be persuaded to swap
his own bowl for the new bowl if he prefers it. The senior bhikkhu should not
refuse to swap out of feeling sorry for the offender (_na ca tassa
anuddayatāya na gahetabbo_), otherwise it is a dukkaṭa offence (_yo na
gaṇheyya āpatti dukkaṭassa_) (Vin.3.247).

In whatever village or town the noble young man lives,
he consorts with and converses with householders and their sons, old and young

generosity, and wisdom.

_idha vyagghapajja kulaputto yasmiṃ gāme vā nigame vā paṭivasati tattha

==== Introduction

===== Five varieties of sensuous pleasure

The five varieties of sensuous pleasure (_pañcakāmaguṇā_) are visible
objects, audible objects, smellable objects, tasteable objects, and tangible
objects that are likeable, loveable, pleasing, agreeable, connected with
sensuous pleasure, and charming (_iṭṭhā kantā manāpā piyarūpā
kāmūpasaṃhitā rajanīyā_).

These pleasures are vile, coarse and ignoble (_mīḷhasukhaṃ
puthujjanasukhaṃ anariyasukhaṃ_). They should not be pursued, developed or
cultivated (_na sevitabbaṃ na bhāvetabbaṃ na bahulīkātabbaṃ_ M.1.454).

The five varieties of sensuous pleasure (_pañcakāmaguṇā_) are sometimes
euphemistically called 'the music of the fivefold ensemble' (_pañcaṅgikena
turiyena_: S.1.131).

===== Kāma: sexual pleasure

_Kāma_ strongly implies sexual pleasure (_mānusake kāme_: S.1.9). There is
no other object which so overwhelms a man's mind as a woman, or a woman's mind,
a man (_cittaṃ pariyādāya tiṭṭhati_: A.1.1).

===== Kāma: not just sex

But _kāma_ is not just sex. After all, the attractiveness of women is more
than their sexuality. It is their wealth, virtue, industriousness, and ability
to beget children (S.4.238). And during the pregnancy of the Bodhisatta's
mother, the sensuous thoughts that arose in her mind did not involve men (_na
bodhisattamātu purisesu mānasaṃ uppajjati kāmaguṇūpasaṃhitaṃ_)
(D.2.13).

Likewise for men. When a group of young Licchavis discussed the 'five
treasures,' the Buddha mocked them for their preoccupation with _kāma_
(_kāmaññeva ārabbha antarā kathā udapādi_), explaining the five
treasures as not just the Woman Treasure, but the Elephant, Horse, Jewel, and
Steward Treasures (D.2.172).

===== Bhikkhus and sensuous pleasure

Bhikkhus are not allowed the five varieties of sensuous pleasure:

____
He for whom the five varieties of sensuous pleasure are allowed, you can
definitely conclude that this is not the practice of an ascetic, not the
practice of a disciple of the Sakyans' Son.

_Yassa pañcakāmaguṇā kappanti ekaṃsenetaṃ gāmaṇi dhāreyyāsi
assamaṇadhammo asakyaputtiyadhammo ti._
____

Such pleasure is only allowed to those for whom money is allowed:

[quote, S.4.326]
____
Those for whom gold and silver are allowed, the five varieties of sensuous
pleasure are allowed._

_yassa kho gāmaṇi jātarūparajataṃ kappati pañcapi tassa kāmaguṇā
kappanti._
____

Bhikkhus should regard sensuous pleasure like a [red-hot] charcoal pit:

[quote, S.4.188]
____
So, too, when sensuous pleasures are seen by a bhikkhu as similar to a
[red-hot] charcoal pit, then sensuous hankering, love, infatuation, and passion
for sensuous pleasures do not lurk within him.

_Evameva kho bhikkhave bhikkhuno aṅgārakāsūpamā kāmā diṭṭhā honti
yathāssa kāme passato yo kāmesu kāmacchando kāmasneho kāmamucchā
kāmapariḷāho so nānuseti._
____

Indeed, the undoing (_upaddava_) of a recluse is, once surrounded by laypeople,
reverting to indulgence:

[quote, M.3.116]
____
Being visited by brahmans and householders from town and country, he becomes
infatuated, falls in love, succumbs to greed, and reverts to luxury. This is
called the teacher who is undone through the undoing of teachers.

_So anvāvaṭṭantesu brāhmaṇagahapatikesu negamesu ceva jānapadesu ca
mucchati nikāyamati gedhaṃ āpajjati āvaṭṭati bāhullāya. Ayaṃ
vuccatānanda upaddavo ācariyo ācariyūpaddavena._
____

===== Objects of sensuous pleasure

Objects of sensuous pleasure include:

- fancy carriages, earrings (M.1.365)

- palaces and female musicians (M.1.504).

- fields, property and gold, cattle and horses, slaves, servants, and maids
(Sn.v.769).

- Heavenly objects of sensuous pleasure includes the company of celestial
nymphs (_accharā_) in the Nandana Grove (M.1.505).

- For Wheel-turning monarchs such objects include the seven Treasures (M.3.172).

===== Allowances in times of sickness

Some items are considered not sensuous pleasures in the case of sickness. For
instance, vehicles, sunshades, and sandals are allowed to bhikkhus and
bhikkhunīs when they are sick.

===== Kāma: sensuous yearning

_Kāma_ can also mean 'sensuous yearning':

[quote, A.3.411]
____
There are five varieties of sensuous pleasure.

_pañcime bhikkhave kāmaguṇā_

Visible objects known via the visual sense... tangible objects known via the
tactile sense, all of which are likeable, loveable, pleasing, agreeable,
connected with sensuous pleasure, and charming

_cakkhuviññeyyā rūpā... kāyaviññeyyā phoṭṭhabbā iṭṭhā
kantāmanāpā piyarūpā kāmupasaṃhitā rajaniyā._

These however are not sensuous yearnings.

_Apica kho bhikkhave nete kāmā_

In the [terminology of the] Noble One's training system they are called the
varieties of sensuous pleasure.

_kāmaguṇā nāmete ariyassa vinaye vuccanti_

The sensuous yearning of a man is his thoughts bound up with attachment.

_Saṅkapparāgo purisassa kāmo_

The world's attractive things are not sensuous yearning

_Nete kāmā yāni citrāni loke_

The sensuous yearning of a man is his thoughts bound up with attachment.

_Saṅkapparāgo purisassa kāmo_

The world's attractive things remain as they are

_Tiṭṭhanti citrāni tatheva loke_

The wise eliminate their hankering for them

_Athettha dhīrā vinayanti chandan ti._
____

Comment:

We render _saṅkapparāgo_ as 'thoughts bound up with attachment' in
accordance with the term 'thoughts bound up with attachment' (_saṅkappā
rāganissitā_, A.1.280; Th.v.760; Dh.v.339).

===== Kāmadhātu: the sensuous plane of existence

So because the low plane of existence is called _kāmadhātu_, should it be
called the sensuous plane of existence? Or the plane of sensuous yearning? For
example, Bodhi calls it 'the sensory realm' (A.1.223) whereas Woodward and
Walshe call it the 'world of sense-desire' (A.1.223; D.2.57). We prefer Bodhi's
term for the following reason:

The _Lokāyatika Brāhmaṇa Sutta_ (A.4.430) says that in the [terminology of
the] Noble One's training system, the five varieties of sensuous pleasure are
called 'the world [of sensuous pleasure]' (_pañcime brāhmaṇā kāmaguṇā
ariyassa vinaye loko ti vuccati_), and says that if a bhikkhu enters first
jhāna, he is called a bhikkhu who has arrived at the end of the world (i.e.
arrived at the end of the world [of sensuous pleasure], _lokassa antaṃ
āgamma_).

But just as the jhānas transcend the five varieties of sensuous pleasure, so
they are themselves transcended by the immaterial states of awareness, which
are said to 'transcend the refined material states of awareness' (_atikkamma
rūpe_) (M.1.34). Because the first of these spheres, the sphere of infinite
space, is attained by 'completely transcending refined material states of
awareness' (_sabbaso rūpasaññānaṃ samatikkamā_), it shows that the
refined material states of awareness means the four jhānas.

Thus on attaining first jhāna, sensuous mental imagery is ended (_paṭhamaṃ
jhānaṃ samāpannassa kāmasaññā niruddhā hoti_, A.4.409), and in
attaining the state of awareness of boundless space, the perception of the
refined material states of awareness is ended (_ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ
samāpannassa rūpasaññā niruddhā hoti_, A.4.409). Thus there are three
levels of meditative attainment. These three levels correspond to the three
states of individual existence (_tayo bhavā_), namely:

- _kāmabhavo_: individual existence in the sensuous plane of existence
(_kāmadhātu_)

- _rūpabhavo_: individual existence in the refined material plane of existence
(_rūpadhātu_)

- _arūpabhavo_: individual existence in the immaterial plane of existence
(_arūpadhātu_) (M.1.50).

The correspondence between the three levels of meditative attainment and the
three states of individual existence is confirmed in connection to rebirth.
Those practising first jhāna, which is the first of the refined material
meditations, when they die, get reborn in the refined material plane of
existence amongst the devas of the Brahmā group (_brahmakāyikānaṃ
devānaṃ sahavyataṃ upapajjati_). Those who practise the state of awareness
of boundless space, which is the first of the immaterial meditations, are
reborn amongst the immaterial devas in the state of awareness of boundless
space (_ākāsānañcāyatanūpagānaṃ devānaṃ sahavyataṃ upapajjati_).

Thus:

- the perception of the five varieties of sensuous pleasure corresponds to
individual existence in the sensuous plane of existence (_kāmadhātu_)

- the refined material states of awareness correspond to the refined material
plane of existence.

- immaterial states of awareness correspond to the immaterial plane of
existence.

This shows that _kāmadhātu_ means 'the sensuous plane of existence,' not 'the
plane of sensuous yearning.'

===== Sensuous, adjective

_Kāmā_ is sometimes used as an adjective: 'sensuous.'

[quote, M.1.433]
____

===== Possessions suitable for laymen devoted to sensuous pleasures

When bhikkhus entered a village with their sandals on, people complained,
muttered, and grumbled that the bhikkhus were like laymen devoted to sensuous
pleasures (_seyyathā pi gihī kāmabhogino ti_ Vin.1.194). This led to the
Buddha forbidding bhikkhus entering the village with sandals on. Other similar
events led to a many items being grouped as suitable for laymen devoted to
sensuous pleasures (_gihī kāmabhogino_) but not bhikkhus. For example, animal
hides (Vin.1.192), gold and silver ointment boxes (Vin.1.203), brightly
coloured or beautiful robes (Vin.1.287, 306), jewellery (Vin.2.106), long hair
(Vin.2.107), hair-dressing equipment (Vin.2.107), fleece clothes with the
fleece outside (Vin.2.108); gold, silver and crystal bowls; ornamented
bowl-stands; gold and silver knives (Vin.2.115); gold and silver thimbles
(Vin.2.117); attractive waistbands (Vin.2.136); gold and silver buckles
(Vin.2.136); large pillows (Vin.2.150).

===== Activities suitable for laymen devoted to sensuous pleasures, gihī kāmabhogino

Likewise there are activities suitable only for laymen devoted to sensuous
pleasures, not bhikkhus: using mirrors (Vin.2.107), wearing make-up
(Vin.2.107), singing (Vin.2.107), sharing dishes and cups (Vin.2.123); trimming
one's hair with scissors (Vin.2.134); removing grey hairs (Vin.2.134); learning
and teaching metaphysics and worldy knowledge (Vin.2.139); going to see
dancing, singing or music (Vin.2.107; Vin.4.267); bathing with perfume
(Vin.4.341); using sunshades (Vin.4.337); using vehicles (Vin.4.338); sharing
beds (Vin.4.288); going to art galleries, public parks and lakes (Vin.4.298);
financial transactions (Vin.3.239); keeping animals (_tiracchānagataṃ
upaṭṭhāpenti_) (Vin.2.267); keeping male and female slaves and servants
(_dāsaṃ... dāsiṃ... kammakāraṃ... kammakāriṃ upaṭṭhāpenti_)
(Vin.2.267); engaging in trade (Vin.2.267).

===== Gihī kāmabhogino: non-celibate laypeople

The Buddha's lay disciples are divided into four groups, according to the sex
and sexuality of their bodies. Here, we call _kāmabhogino_ 'non-celibate .'
All disciples are 'clothed in white' (_odātavasanā_).

[quote, M.1.493]
____
celibate men lay followers

_upāsakā gihī odātavasanā brahmacārino_

non-celibate men lay followers

_upāsakā gihī odātavasanā kāmabhogino_

celibate women lay followers,

_upāsikā gihiniyo odātavasanā brahmacāriṇiyo_

non-celibate women lay followers

_upāsikā gihiniyo odātavasanā kāmabhoginiyo._
____

===== Food and 'sensuous pleasure'

Although food is pleasant, if it was considered a 'sensuous pleasure' the
ascetic life would be impossible. It is nonetheless surprising that there are
no rules on luxurious foods because the _Vatthūpama Sutta_ (M.1.38) shows that
luxurious food is a spiritual obstruction for those with defiled mental states
(_cittassa upakkilesā_) because it says that for the virtuous bhikkhu whose
mind is collected (_cittaṃ samādhiyati_), even if he eats fine almsfood 'the
black grains removed, with various curries and vegetables, that will not be a
spiritual obstruction for him' (_nevassa naṃ hoti antarāyāya_, M.1.38).
This implies that luxurious food is a spiritual obstruction for less
accomplished bhikkhus.

===== Food: the training for bhikkhus

Regarding food, the training in restraint for bhikkhus does not concern the
quality of the food but the timing, the quantity, and the bhikkhu's attitude:

- bhikkhus should ideally eat just once a day.

- they should not eat after midday.

- they should eat in moderation

- they should eat without either cleaving to what is delicious (_nājjhosāya
bhuñje_) or rejecting what is unpalatable (_virodhamāsādusu nopadaṃsaye_
S.4.71; M.1.102; M.1.437).

===== Alcohol

Alcohol is not considered a sensuous pleasure even for Wheel-turning monarchs
because, even by laypeople, it is not a pleasure to be enjoyed at all.

=== Kāye kāyānupassī viharati

==== Renderings

- _kāye kāyānupassī viharati_: he abides contemplating the nature of the
body

==== Introduction

===== Three components

_Kāye kāyānupassī_ has three components.

1. A noun in the locative case (_kaye_)

2. an intermediate noun (_kaya_)

3. _anupassī_, which means 'a contemplator,' but is functionally a present
participle (i.e. 'contemplating'), and confirmed as such in both DOP and PED
(under _anupassi_).

===== Threefold structure in other phrases

This threefold structure occurs in other similar phrases:

[quote, A.5.110]
____
He abides contemplating the wretchedness (i.e. the wretched nature) of the body

_kāye ādīnavānupassī viharati._
____

[quote, A.5.111]
____
He abides contemplating the unloveliness (i.e. the unlovely nature) of the body

_kāye asubhānupassī viharati._
____

The aspect that is contemplated is seen here to be the nature of the object
that is in the locative case. About this, Bodhi says:

- "In each case, the word conjoined with _anupassī_ is the aspect that is
contemplated, and the word in the locative case is the sphere in relation to
which that aspect is contemplated. Analogously, in _kāye kāyānupassī
viharati_, the _kāya_ conjoined with _anupassī_ is the aspect that is
contemplated (the "bodiness" of the body) and the locative _kāye_ is the
domain in relation to which that aspect is contemplated" (NDB n.197).

By comparison, in _kāye kāyānupassī_, the intermediate _kaya_ means
body-nature, or, as Bodhi puts it, 'bodiness.' This leads to our phrase: 'he
abides contemplating the nature of the body.'

===== Confirmation: kāye kāyānupassī equals kāye asubhānupassī

Because unloveliness is the nature of the body, it should be possible to
demonstrate that _kāye kāyānupassī_ equals _kāye asubhānupassī_, which
would confirm our rendering. That these phrases are equivalent is obvious in
the comparison of these two passages:

[quote, A.5.109]
____
In this [wretched human] body there are head hairs... urine. Thus he abides
contemplating the unloveliness of this [wretched human] body.

_atthi imasmiṃ kāye kesā... muttan ti. Iti imasmiṃ kāye asubhānupassī
viharati._
____

[quote, D.2.293]
____
In this [wretched human] body there are head hairs... urine. Thus he abides

In this regard a bhikkhu abides contemplating the nature of the body,
vigorously, fully consciously, and mindfully, having eliminated greed and
dejection in regard to the world [of phenomena].

_idha bhikkhave bhikkhu kāye kāyānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno

He abides contemplating the nature of sense impressions... the nature of the
mind... the nature of certain objects of the systematic teachings... In this
way a bhikkhu is mindful.

=== Kukkucca; Vippaṭisāra

- _kukkucca_: scrupulous

- _kukkucca_: anxiety

- _kukkucca_: remorseful

- _kukkucca_: guilt

==== Introduction

===== Kukkucca: fretting

When Venerable Anuruddha complained that for all his meditation skill, his mind
was still not released from the āsavas, Venerable Sāriputta called this
_kukkucca_, fretting (A.1.281). The subsiding of fretting is therefore linked
to arahantship. This association is confirmed in the following verse:

[quote, Sn.v.481]
____
Serve with other food and drink the one who is spiritually perfected, the great
Seer, one whose _āsavas_ are destroyed, whose fretting has subsided, for he is
the [unsurpassed] field for one looking for merit.

_Aññena ca kevalinaṃ mahesiṃ khīṇāsavaṃ kukkuccavūpasantaṃ +
Annena pānena upaṭṭhahassu khettaṃ hi taṃ puññapekkhassa hoti._
____

===== Kukkucca: scrupulousness

When a sick bhikkhu refused to use a vehicle out of respect of the bhikkhus'
discipline, it was from scrupulousness (_kukkuccāyanto_ Vin.1.191).

===== Kukkucca: remorse

When, through sickness, Venerable Vakkali was unable to visit the Buddha, he
felt remorseful about it (_kukkuccaṃ_, S.3.120).

When they break their precepts bhikkhus feel remorseful (_kukkuccaṃ_
S.3.120). This is linked to _vippaṭisāro_ (being conscience-stricken) and
_attā sīlato upavadatī_ (reproaching oneself in regard to virtue).

===== Kukkucca: anxiety

Sometimes _kukkucca_ is the anxiety associated with the thought 'I hope I have
not fallen into an offence': _Tesaṃ kukkuccaṃ ahosi. Bhagavatā
sikkhāpadaṃ paññattaṃ. Kacci nu kho mayaṃ pārājikaṃ āpattiṃ
āpannā ti_ (Vin.3.34). See Illustrations.

===== Kukkucca: guilt

When bhikkhus impatiently recited the Pātimokkha instead of waiting for the
other bhikkhus to arrive, knowing it was wrongful to do so, they recited it
'guiltily' (_kukkuccapakatā_ Vin.1.131).

===== Vippaṭisāra: uneasiness

An example of uneasiness is found in the assertion that a Perfect One exists
after death (_hoti tathāgato parammaraṇā ti_), or does not exist. This is a
matter of uneasiness (_vippaṭisāro eso_, A.4.68-9) presumably because any
theory of the Buddha either existing or not existing after death is
philosophically disasterous.

===== Kukkuccaṃ plus vippaṭisāro: remorseful and conscience-stricken

When _kukkuccaṃ_ occurs in combination with _vippaṭisāro_ the pair of
terms can mean either 'remorseful and conscience-stricken' or 'anxious and
uneasy.' For example, when a chief minister became angry with the bhikkhus, and
insulted them, he was remorseful and conscience-stricken about it (_ahudeva
kukkuccaṃ ahu vippaṭisāro_ Vin.1.223).

[quote, Vin.1.223]
____
But soon after the Blessed One had departed, that chief minister, young in
faith, became remorseful and conscience-stricken and thought: It is a loss for
me, not a gain; it is unfortunate for me, not fortunate, that I, angry and
displeased, wanting to insult the bhikkhus, went round filling their bowls and
saying: 'Eat it or take it away'. Now, have I made much merit or demerit?

_Atha kho tassa taruṇappasannassa mahāmattassa acirapakkantassa bhagavato
ahudeva kukkuccaṃ. Ahu vippaṭisāro alābhā vata me na vata me lābhā
dulladdhaṃ vata me na vata me suladdhaṃ yohaṃ kupito anattamano

haratha vā' ti. Kinnu kho mayā bahuṃ pasutaṃ puññaṃ vā apuññaṃ

____

===== Kukkuccaṃ plus vippaṭisāro: anxiety and uneasiness

But when Venerable Assaji found he could no longer attain inward collectedness,
he became anxious and uneasy (_anappakaṃ kukkuccaṃ anappako
vippaṭisāro_) because he thought it would ruin him:

[quote, S.3.125]
____
As I do not attain that inward collectedness, bhante, it occurs to me: 'May I
not waste away!'

=== Kulaputta

==== Renderings

- _kulaputta_: noble young man

- _kulaputta_: of noble ancestry

- _kulaputta_: a member of the gentry

- _kulaputta_: son of a genteel family

- _kulaputta_: son of an aristocratic family

==== Introduction

===== Kulaputta: sonship, youth, and high social background

DOP says _kulaputta_ means either

1. the son of a good or noble family

2. a noble youth.

So -_putta_ does not necessarily mean 'son.' We will see that it more often
indicates 'youth.' In some cases it indicates a high social background ('of the
genteel classes'). That -_putta_ indicates youth but not boyhood is our next
point.

===== Kulaputta: youth not boyhood, part 1

Although -_putta_ means youth, it does not mean boyhood. For example, when
Venerable Anuruddha is called _kulaputta_ at M.1.205, he would have been at
least 35 years old for the following reasons:

1. At that time he was an arahant (M.1.205).

2. Th.v.904 says it took him 30 years to overcome torpor (_middhaṃ
samūhataṃ_), which is therefore when he attained arahantship, because only
arahants have completely abandoned lethargy and torpor
(_thīnamiddhanīvaraṇaṃ_, S.5.327).

3. His age at ordination is uncertain, but given that his brother informed him
of the duties that would fall to him if he remained a layperson, he was likely
between 5-20 years old (Vin.2.180-1).

===== Kulaputta: youth not boyhood, part 2

That _kulaputta_ means youth not boyhood is also obvious in the
_Licchavikumāra Sutta_, which says this:

[quote, A.3.76]
____
Mahānāma, in whatever _kulaputta_ five qualities are found -- whether he is a
consecrated noble king, a country gentleman, an army general, a village
headman, a guildmaster, or someone who exercises personal authority over
various families -- only growth [in spiritually wholesome factors] is to be
expected for him, not a falling away [from them]. What five?

_Yassa kassaci mahānāma kulaputtassa pañcadhammā saṃvijjanti yadi vā
rañño khattiyassa muddhābhisittassa yadi vā raṭṭhikassa pettanikassa
yadi vā senāya senāpatikassa yadi vā gāmagāmikassa yadi vā
pūgagāmaṇikassa ye vā pana kulesu paccekādhipaccaṃ kārenti vuddhiyeva
pāṭikaṅkhā no parihāni. Katame pañca?._
____

If army generals and village headmen are _kulaputtas_, then _kulaputta_ does
not mean boyhood. We also see that _kulaputta_ is associated with the gentry,
which suggests the rendering 'noble young man.'

===== Kulaputto: of noble ancestry

Although Ambaṭṭha considered himself a brahman, the Buddha said he was in
fact descended from a slavegirl (_dāsiputto_ D.1.92). Ambaṭṭha's friends
initially defended him, saying he was of pure ancestry (_sujāto_) and a
_kulaputto_. But on discovering the truth, they said he was of impure ancestry
(_dujjāto_), an _akulaputto_, descended from a slave (_dāsiputto_).

So, according to brahmans, _kulaputto_ was an exalted term associated with the
most prestigious members of their group, the _sujāto_, and incompatible with
slavish forebears. _Kulaputta_ therefore means 'of noble ancestry.'

The significance of _sujāto_ can be seen in the following conversation, where
it is the first quality expected of a brahman who is a master of threefold
Vedic knowledge:

[quote, A.1.166]
____
-- 'In what way, brahman, do brahmans declare a brahman to be a master of
threefold Vedic knowledge?'

_Yathākathaṃ pana brāhmaṇa brāhmaṇā brāhmaṇaṃ tevijjaṃ
paññāpentī ti_

-- In this regard, Master Gotama, a brahman is of pure ancestry (_sujāto
hoti_) on both sides of his family, of pure descent, unimpeachable and
irreproachable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh generation.

_Idha pana bho gotama brāhmaṇo ubhato sujāto hoti mātito ca pitito ca
saṃsuddhagahaṇiko yāva sattamā pitāmahāyugā akkhitto anupakkuṭṭho
jātivādena._
____

===== Kulaputto: member of the gentry

Related to noble ancestry is gentility. When Venerable Upananda asked a certain
great merchant (_aññataro seṭṭhiputto_) to give him one of his two robes,
the man replied:

[quote, Vin.3.211]
____
But, bhante, for us who are members of the gentry, it is awkward to walk around
with only one piece of cloth.

_Amhākaṃ kho bhante kulaputtānaṃ kismiṃ viya ekasāṭakaṃ gantuṃ._
____

Comment:

We call _seṭṭhiputto_ 'great merchant' not 'son of a great merchant,'
taking _-putto_ as pleonastic.

===== Kulaputto: sons of genteel families

Related to noble ancestry and gentility is a delicate upbringing. For example,
Anuruddha the Sakyan had three palaces. When his brother invited him to become
a bhikkhu, he complained:

[quote, Vin.2.180]
____
But I have been delicately nurtured, I am not able to go forth from the
household life into the ascetic life.

_Ahaṃ kho sukhumālo. Nāhaṃ sakkomi agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajituṃ._
____

The Buddha helped such individuals by providing them with sufficient clothing.
He reflected:

[quote, Vin.1.288]
____
Even those in this teaching and training system who are sons of genteel
families and susceptible to cold, afraid of cold, even these are able to keep
themselves going with three robes.

_yepi kho te kulaputtā imasmiṃ dhammavinaye pabbajitā sītālukā
sītabhīrukā tepi sakkonti ticīvarena yāpetu._
____

===== Kulaputto: sons of aristocratic families

In relation to 'highly distinguished,' we give _kulaputtā_ the meaning 'sons
of the aristocratic families':

[quote, Vin.1.43]
____
Now at that time highly distinguished sons of the aristocratic families of
Magadha were living the religious life under the Blessed One.

_Tena kho pana samayena abhiññātā abhiññātā māgadhakā kulaputtā
bhagavati brahmacariyaṃ caranti._
____

===== Kulaputta: spiritual nobility

[quote, M.1.206]
____
When Venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were living together in the
Gosinga Sāla-tree Wood, their utmost harmony was shielded by a zealous
gatekeeper who so diligently defended the place against visitors, that when on
one occasion the Buddha dared enter uninvited, he was told 'Do not enter this
grove, ascetic! There are three _kulaputtas_ here seeking their Soul. Do not
disturb them!'

_mā samaṇa etaṃ dāyaṃ pāvisi sant'ettha tayo kulaputtā
attakāmarūpā viharanti mā tesaṃ aphāsumakāsī ti._
____

The gatekeeper would hardly have meant this with social connotations 'There are
three member of the gentry living here,' and _kulaputta_ here seems to imply
spiritual nobility. We have seen above that this sense is not just for
bhikkhus. We render it as 'noble young man.'

===== Kulaputta versus moghapurisā: noble young man

That the elevated connotations of _kulaputto_ extend to the spiritual sphere
can be discerned when the Buddha contrasted _kulaputtā_ and _moghapurisā_:

[quote, A.3.359]
____
Thus do noble young men (_kulaputtā_) declare their [attainment of]
arahantship. The matter is spoken of without any reference to themselves.

_evaṃ kho bhikkhave kulaputtā aññaṃ vyākaronti attho ca vutto attā ca
anupanīto._

(...) Yet there are some worthless men (_moghapurisā_) here who apparently
declare [that they have attained] arahantship for fun.

_Atha ca pana idhekacce moghapurisā hasamānakā maññe aññaṃ
vyākaronti._
____

===== Kulaputta versus 'persons' (puggalā)

Similarly, Gaṇaka Moggallāna contrasted _kulaputtā_ with _puggalā_:

==== Introduction

===== Rendering akusala and kusala

Rendering _akusala_ and _kusala_ as spiritually unwholesome or wholesome is
justified by their association with defilement and purity, with
uninsightfulness and insightfulness, as seen in the following passages:

1. He has been struck down by unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors that
are defiling, and which lead to renewed states of individual existence,
suffering, unpleasant karmic consequences, and future birth, old age, and death.
+
****
_avadhiṃsu naṃ pāpakā akusalā dhammā saṅkilesikā ponobhavikā
sadarā dukkhavipākā āyatiṃ jātijarāmaraṇiyā_ (M.3.116).
****

2. Even so did I see the danger, degradation, and defilement in spiritually
unwholesome factors, and in spiritually wholesome factors and in the practice
of unsensuousness, I saw the advantage and associated purity.
+
****
_Evameva kho ahaṃ bhikkhave addasaṃ akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ ādīnavaṃ
okāraṃ saṅkilesaṃ kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ nekkhamme ānisaṃsaṃ
vodānapakkhaṃ._ (M.1.115).
****

3. There are these three kinds of spiritually unwholesome thoughts that produce
spiritual blindness, uninsightfulness, ignorance [of things according to
reality], and are destructive of penetrative discernment, vexatious, and not
conducive to the Untroubled. Which three?
+
****
_Tayo'me bhikkhave akusalavitakkā andhakaraṇā acakkhukaraṇā
aññāṇakaraṇā paññānirodhikā vighātapakkhikā
anibbānasaṃvattanikā. Katame tayo?_ (It.82).

===== Essence of akusala: five hindrances

The essence of _akusala_ is found in the five hindrances, because:

____
If one were to say of anything 'a spiritually unwholesome heap,' it is about
the five hindrances that one could rightly say this.

_Akusalarāsī ti bhikkhave vadamāno pañcanīvaraṇe sammā vadamano
vadeyya._
____

Each of the five hindrances is called:

a spiritual obstruction, a spiritual hindrance, a spiritual defilement, a
weakener of penetrative discernment.

_āvaraṇā nīvaraṇā cetaso upakkilesā paññāya dubbalīkaraṇā._
____

===== Essence of kusala: four bases of mindfulness

The essence of _kusala_ is found in four bases of mindfulness, because:

[quote, S.5.145-6]
____
If one were to say of anything 'a spiritually wholesome heap,' it is about the
[contemplation of the] four bases of mindfulness that one could rightly say
this.

[quote, S.5.142]
____
the one-destination path for the purification of beings

_ekāyano ayaṃ bhikkhave maggo sattānaṃ visuddhiyā._
____

===== Kusala and akusala: conduct of body, speech, and mind

1. _Akusala_ is found in conduct like frivolous speech (_samphappalāpo
akusalaṃ_) and killing (_pāṇātipāto akusalaṃ_).

2. Refraining from such conduct is _kusala_ (_samphappalāpā veramaṇī
kusalaṃ_).

3. _Akusala_ is found in mental conduct:
+
____
Sensuous thought, unbenevolent thought, malicious thought. These are called
spiritually unwholesome thoughts.

_kāmasaṅkappo vyāpādasaṅkappo vihiṃsāsaṅkappo ime vuccanti thapati
akusalasaṅkappā._

_avyāpādo kusalaṃ_

===== People and objects: not kusala or akusala

Therefore people and objects (apart from mental objects) are not spiritually
wholesome or unwholesome. Neither, in themselves, are religious teachings,
which instead we call 'wholesome' and 'unwholesome':

[quote, A.1.190]
____
Kālāmas, if you yourselves should consider: "These teachings are wholesome...
you should accept and abide by them.

____

[quote, A.1.190]
____
Kālāmas, if you yourselves should consider: "These teachings are
unwholesome... you should abandon them.

_Yadā tumhe kālāmā attanāva jāneyyātha ime dhammā akusalā... atha
tumhe kālāmā pajaheyyātha._
____

But the practice of religious teachings is a different matter:

[quote, A.5.241]
____
Wrong view [of reality], wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong conduct, wrong
means of livelihood, wrong endeavour, wrong mindfulness, wrong inward
collectedness, wrong knowledge [of things according to reality], wrong
liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]: this is called spiritually
unwholesome.

_Micchādiṭṭhi micchāsaṅkappo micchāvācā micchākammanto
micchāājīvo micchāvāyāmo micchāsati micchāsamādhi micchāñāṇaṃ
micchāvimutti idaṃ vuccati bhikkhave akusalaṃ._
____

[quote, A.5.241]
____
Right perception [of reality], right thought, right speech, right conduct,
right means of livelihood, right endeavour, right mindfulness, right inward
collectedness, right knowledge [of things according to reality], right
liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]: this is called spiritually
wholesome.

_Sammādiṭṭhi sammāsaṅkappo sammāvācā sammākammanto sammāājīvo
sammāvāyāmo sammāsati sammāsamādhi sammāñāṇaṃ sammāvimutti idaṃ
vuccati bhikkhave kusalan ti._

Sometimes _kvaci_ implies the emphasis, 'in any way':

1. Though a youth, he is not attached in any way.

****
_yo yobbane nopanibajjhate kvaci_ (Sn.v.218).
****

2. May attachment to charming things of any kind never in any way or in any

****
_Mā me kvacani katthaci kiñcana rajanīyesu dhammesu rāgo udapādi_
(A.3.170).
****

===== Other renderings: DOP and Bodhi

DOP seems to reject the emphatic effect of _kvacani_, because it explains it as
'somewhere, anywhere, in or regard to anything.' But Bodhi accepts it, saying
'Let no lust at all arise in me anywhere in any way regarding things
provocative of lust' (NDB p.762).

Comment:

The _Uposatha Sutta_ (A.1.206) says the particular application of this
contemplation is in personal relationships, where:

1. a man's parents know him as their son, and he knows them as his parents
+
****
_ayaṃ amhākaṃ putto ti so pi jānāti ime mayhaṃ mātāpitaro ti_.
****

2. a man's slaves and servants know him as their master, and he knows them as
his slaves and servants
+
****
_ayaṃ amhākaṃ ayyo ti. So pi jānāti ime mayhaṃ dāsakammakaraporisā

This reflection therefore helps overcome the idea that beings possess each
other.

=== Khila

==== Renderings

- _khilajāta_: hardhearted

- _khila_: hardheartedness

- _khila_: remissness in practising the teaching

- _cetokhilā_: remissness in practising the teaching

==== Introduction

===== Remissness in practising the teaching

PED says _khila_ means 'waste or fallow land' and that figuratively it
therefore means 'barrenness of mind.' In fact barren land is _pāpabhumi_
(S.4.315), and since 'barren' means 'unproductive,' it is hard to see how the
mind could be meaningfully called 'barren.' This figurative sense is more
appropriate if applied to the unproductiveness of a negligent bhikkhu, who, for
various reasons does not apply himself properly to the practice. In this sense
we call _khila_ 'remissness in practising the teaching,' for example in the
following passage:

[quote, D.3.237-8]
____
One whose mind does not incline to vigour, application, perseverance, and
inward striving... this is the first variety of remissness in practising the
teaching.

_Yassa cittaṃ na namati ātappāya anuyogāya sātaccayā padhānāya ayaṃ
paṭhamo cetokhilo... ayaṃ pañcamo cetokhilo._
____

===== Hardheartedness

The DOP says _khilo_ can mean land that is hardened by lack of rain. This
supports our second rendering for _khilo,_ 'hardheartedness.'

===== With pabhindati

In both meanings, _khila_ is used with the verb _pabhindati_:

[quote, Sn.v.973]
____
He should split asunder the hardheartedness he might have towards his
companions in the religious life.

_sabrahmacārīsu khilaṃ pabhinde._

saṅghādisesa offence.

=== Gaṇḍa

==== Renderings

- _gaṇḍa_: carbuncle

==== Introduction

===== Carbuncles and ordination

_Gaṇḍa_ is a serious disease that can block a bhikkhu candidate's
ordination (_na bhikkhave pañcahi ābādhehi phuṭṭho pabbājetabbo_,
Vin.1.73). Accordingly, it seems appropriate to call _gaṇḍa_ 'carbuncle,'
not 'boil,' because a carbuncle is 'somewhat like a boil, but more serious in
its effects' (http:// dictionary.reference.com). One would not expect a boil to
block one's ordination.

===== The body as a carbuncle

The body is compared to a _gaṇḍa_ with nine orifices (_nava vaṇamukhāni_
A.4.386). Whatever flows out of a _gaṇḍa_ is foul, foul-smelling, and
disgusting (_asuciññeva pagghareyya duggandhañceva pagghareyya
jegucchiyaññeva pagghareyya_). This again suggests carbuncle, not boil,
because a carbuncle 'is an abscess larger than a boil, usually with one or more
openings, draining pus onto the skin' (en.wiktionary.org).

===== The aggregates: carbuncles

The five aggregates are like five carbuncles, presumably because of the chronic
misery associated with them:

[quote, "M.1.435-7, A.4.422-6"]
____
Whatever phenomena are connected with the five aggregates, he sees those
states... as an illness, as a carbuncle...

_so yadeva tattha hoti rūpagataṃ vedanāgataṃ saññāgataṃ
saṅkhāragataṃ viññāṇagataṃ te dhamme... rogato gaṇḍato...
samanupassati._
____

For full quote, see Illustrations.

===== The notion "I am": carbuncle

The Buddha applied the term metaphorically to the notion "I am":

[quote, S.4.203]
____
The notion "I am" is a matter of thinking in personal terms

_asmī ti maññitametaṃ_

'I am this' is a matter of thinking in personal terms

_ayamahamasmī ti maññitametaṃ_

'I will be' is a matter of thinking in personal terms

_bhavissan ti maññitametaṃ_

'I will not be' is a matter of thinking in personal terms

_na bhavissan ti maññitametaṃ_

... Thinking in personal terms is an illness, a carbuncle, a [piercing]
arrow. Therefore train yourselves with the thought, 'We will live with minds
free of thinking in personal terms'

_maññitaṃ bhikkhave rogo maññitaṃ gaṇḍo maññitaṃ sallaṃ
tasmātiha bhikkhave amaññamānena cetasā viharissāmāti evaṃ hi vo
bhikkhave sikkhitabbaṃ._
____

===== Sensuous pleasures: carbuncle

Sensuous pleasures are called a carbuncle because they are associated with
carbuncles, presumably meaning the aggregates, or even the notion "I am":

[quote, A.3.310]
____
Bhikkhus, 'carbuncle' is an epithet for sensuous pleasures. Why so? Because one
who is passionately attached to sensuous pleasure, fastened by fondness and
attachment, is neither free of carbuncles in this lifetime, nor in the
hereafter, therefore 'carbuncle' is an epithet for sensuous pleasures.

_gaṇḍo ti bhikkhave kāmānametaṃ adhivacanaṃ. Kasmā ca bhikkhave
gaṇḍo ti kāmānametaṃ adhivacanaṃ. Yasmā ca kāmarāgarattāyaṃ
bhikkhave chandarāgavinibaddho diṭṭhadhammikāpi gaṇḍā na parimuccati

[quote, A.4.386]

Bhikkhus, suppose there was a carbuncle many years old, and which had nine
openings, nine orifices. Whatever oozes out of them would be foul,
foul-smelling, and disgusting.

_gaṇḍo anekavassagaṇiko tassassu nava vaṇamukhāni nava
abhedanamukhāni tato yaṃ kiñci pagghareyya asuciññeva pagghareyya
duggandhañceva pagghareyya jegucchiyaññeva pagghareyya._

A 'carbuncle' is a metaphor for this [wretched human] body made of the four
great material phenomena.

_'Gaṇḍo ti kho bhikkhave imasseva cātummahābhūtikassa kāyassa
adhivacanaṃ_

It has nine openings, nine orifices.

_tassa nava vanamukhāni nava abhedanamukhāni_

offence of pācittiya.

_Yā pana bhikkhunī pasākhe jātaṃ gaṇḍaṃ vā ruhitaṃ vā

=== Gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāra

==== Renderings

- _gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāra_: necessities, remedies, and essentials
[that are needed] when ill

- _gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāra_: therapeutic requisites

==== Introduction

===== Full and abbreviated terms

_Gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāraṃ_ means 'necessities, remedies, and
essentials [that are needed] when ill.' This is unwieldy. We usually abbreviate
it to 'therapeutic requisites.'

[quote, A.3.338]
____
Properly reflecting, he uses therapeutic requisites simply to ward off
troublesome feelings that have arisen and for maximum freedom from affliction.

_Paṭisaṅkhā yoniso gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāraṃ paṭisevati
yāvadeva uppannānaṃ veyyābādhikānaṃ vedanānaṃ paṭighātāya
avyābajjhaparamatāya._
____

===== Gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāra: not 'medicinal requisites'

We call it 'therapeutic requisites' not 'medicinal requisites,' because its
most prominent aspect is the five nutritive substances which bhikkhus can
consume in the evening:

[quote, V.1.200]
____
These five remedies, that is to say ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, molasses,
are remedies and are also agreed upon as remedies, and although they serve as
nutriment for people yet they cannot be reckoned as substantial food.

_imāni kho pañca bhesajjāni seyyathīdaṃ sappi navanītaṃ telaṃ madhu
phāṇitaṃ bhesajjāni ceva bhesajjasammatāni ca lokassa āhāratthañca
pharanti na ca oḷāriko āhāro paññāyati._
____

===== Parsing of gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāraṃ

The correct parsing of _gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāraṃ_ can be judged
from these quotes:

1. Now at that time monks became ill and needed remedies.
+
****
_Tena kho pana samayena bhikkhu gilānā honti attho ca hoti bhesajjehi_
(Vin.4.100).
****

2. 'Give food for the sick, give food for those who nurse the sick, give
remedies for the sick'
+
****
_Gilānabhattaṃ detha. Gilānupaṭṭhākabhattaṃ detha.
Gilānabhesajjaṃ dethā ti_ (Vin.1.72).
****

[quote, Vin.4.102]
____
3a) A four-month invitation [to ask] for necessities can be accepted by a
bhikkhu who is not ill.

_Agilānena bhikkhunā cātumāsapaccayapavāraṇā sāditabbā._
____

[quote, Vin.4.102]
____
3b) A four-month invitation [to ask] for necessities can be accepted by a
bhikkhu who is not ill means: an invitation [to ask] for necessities [that are
needed] when ill may be accepted.

_Agilānena bhikkhunā cātumāsappaccayapavāraṇā sāditabbā ti:
gilānapaccayapavāraṇā sāditabbā._
____

[quote, Vin.4.103]
____
3c) If one should accept for longer than that means: there is an invitation
limited to remedies, not limited to nights etc.

_Tato ce uttariṃ sādiyeyyāti: atthi pavāraṇā bhesajjapariyantā na
rattipariyantā._
____

From these we conclude:

1. When people are ill, there is a 'need' for remedies (_attho ca hoti_).

2. _Gilānabhesajjaṃ_ means 'remedies for the sick.'

3a) _Paccaya_ means 'necessities'.

3b) _Gilānapaccaya_ means 'necessities [that are needed] when ill.'

3c) _Gilānapaccaya_ is a near synonym of _bhesajja._

===== In verse: paccaya

In verse _gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāra_ is sometimes abbreviated to
_paccaya_:

[quote, Th.v.484]
____
'Good for those of Aṅga and Magadha whose robe material, almsfood,
therapeutic requisites, abodes, veneration, and homage this one enjoys. Good
for them,' he said.

_Lābhā aṅgānaṃ magadhānaṃ yesāyaṃ paribhuñjati +
Cīvaraṃ piṇḍapātañca paccayaṃ sayanāsanaṃ +
Paccuṭṭhānañca sāmīciṃ tesaṃ lābhā ti cābravi._
____

[quote, Sn.v.339]

'Do not foster craving for robe material, almsfood, therapeutic requisites, and
abodes.

==== Introduction

===== Guṇā: constituent parts

The only problem with _guṇa_ is its use in _pañcakāmaguṇā_, which is
often called 'the five strands of sense pleasure.' The word 'strand' is used
because rope is made of strands, where strands are its constituent parts, says
PED. If this is the case, then _guṇā_ would be less confusingly called
constituent parts, not strands.

===== Guṇā: kinds of

Norman says 'It is sometimes said that _guṇā_ has no meaning in
_kāmaguṇā._ It actually means "kinds of... "' (Group of Discourses, p.160,
note 50-51).

===== Guṇā: varieties of

We say 'kinds of' in the phrase 'he undertakes and practises some kind of
austerity' (_aññataraṃ vā pana tapoguṇaṃ samādāya vattati_: M.2.36).
Bodhi likewise says 'some kind of asceticism'; but we say 'varieties' in the
phrase _pañcime bhikkhave kāmaguṇā_: 'five varieties of sensuous pleasure.'

===== The other guṇa

There are two words _guṇa_, the other one meaning 'ball, cluster, chain,' and
which commonly substitutes with _guḷa_:

[quote, D.2.274]
____
the elephant that bursts all its fastenings and chains

_nāgoca sandānaguṇāni chetvā._

==== Introduction

===== Indriyesu guttadvāro: linked to mindfulness

Because _indriyesu guttadvāro_ is linked to mindfulness, it implies that the
sense faculties are not just 'guarded,' but guarded by mindfulness, which
should therefore be parenthesised.

[quote, A.3.138]
____
Come on, friend, abide with sense portals guarded [by mindfulness]. Take
mindfulness as your supervisor. Be aware and mindful, and have a mind that is
supervised [by mindfulness], a mind under the supervision of mindfulness.

_Etha tumhe āvuso indriyesu guttadvārā viharatha ārakkhasatino
nipakkasatino sārakkhitamānasā satārakkhena cetasā samannāgatāti._
____

===== Indriyesu guttadvāro: linked to mindfulness via saṃvara

_Indriyesu guttadvāro_ is sometimes linked to mindfulness via _saṃvara_,
again implying that the sense faculties are not just 'guarded,' but guarded by
mindfulness. These quotes show _saṃvara_'s relationship to mindfulness:

1. When a bhikkhu has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, the eye
does not incline towards pleasing visible objects nor are displeasing visible
objects loathsome... In this way there is restraint [of the sense faculties]
[from attraction and repulsion, through mindfulness].
+
****
_kāyagatā sati bhāvitā bahulīkatā cakkhu nāviñjati manāpikesu rūpesu
amanāpikassa rūpāni nappaṭikkūlā honti... evaṃ kho bhikkhave saṃvaro
hoti_ (S.4.200).
****

2. What is the condition that nourishes unrestraint of the sense faculties?
Lack of mindfulness and full consciousness, one should reply.
+
****
_Ko cāhāro indriyāsaṃvarassa? Asatāsampajaññan tissa vacanīyaṃ_
(A.5.113).

3. What is the condition that nourishes restraint of the sense faculties [from

===== 'One with sense portals unguarded [by mindfulness]': definition

[quote, S.4.120]
____
-- By virtue of what attributes, Master Kaccāna, is one 'with sense portals
unguarded [by mindfulness]'?"

_kittāvatā nu kho bho kaccāna aguttadvāro hotī ti?_

-- In this regard, brahman, in seeing a visible object via the visual sense,
some person is intent upon an agreeable visible object and troubled by a
disagreeable visible object.

_Idha brāhmaṇa ekacco cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā piyarūpe rūpe adhimuccati
appiyarūpe rūpe vyāpajjati_

(...) He abides without having established mindfulness of the body, with a small
mind, and he does not discern according to reality, with the liberation [from
attachment through inward calm] and the liberation [from uninsightfulness]
through penetrative discernment, where those unvirtuous, spiritually
unwholesome factors cease without remainder.

_anupaṭṭhitakāyasati ca viharati parittacetaso tañca cetovimuttiṃ
paññāvimuttiṃ yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti yatthassa te uppannā pāpakā
akusalā dhammā aparisesā na nirujjhanti_

(...) It is in such a way, brahman, that one has sense portals unguarded [by
mindfulness]

_Evaṃ kho brāhmaṇa aguttadvāro hotī ti._
____

===== 'One with sense portals guarded [by mindfulness]': definition

____
And how is a bhikkhu one with sense portals guarded [by mindfulness]?

_kathañca bhikkhave bhikkhu indriyesu guttadvāro hoti._

In this regard, in seeing a visible object via the visual sense, a bhikkhu does
not grasp its aspects and features. Since, by abiding with the faculty of sight
unrestrained [from attraction and repulsion, through mindfulness], greed,
dejection, and unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors would pursue him. He
applies himself to the restraint of the faculty [from attraction and repulsion,
through mindfulness], he supervises the faculty of sight [with mindfulness], he
attains restraint of the faculty of sight [through mindfulness].

_cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā na nimittaggāhī hoti nānuvyañjanaggāhī
yatvādhikaraṇamenaṃ cakkhundriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ viharantaṃ abhijjhā
domanassā pāpakā akusalā dhammā anvāssaveyyuṃ tassa saṃvarāya
paṭipajjati rakkhati cakkhundriyaṃ cakkhundriye saṃvaraṃ āpajjati._
____

Suppose a chariot harnessed to thoroughbreds was standing ready on even ground
at a crossroads, with a goad on hand. Then a proficient handler, a trainer of
horses to be tamed, would mount it and, taking the reins in his left hand and
the goad in his right, would drive away and return by any route he wants,
whenever he wants.

So, too, a bhikkhu trains in

[quote, S.4.176]
____
supervising these six sense faculties [with mindfulness]

_imesaṃ channaṃ indriyānaṃ ārakkhāya sikkhati_

restraining them [with mindfulness]

_saṃyamāya sikkhati_

taming them [with mindfulness]

_damāya sikkhati_

calming them [with mindfulness]

_upasamāya sikkhati_

In this way a bhikkhu has sense portals guarded [by mindfulness].

Bhikkhus, this is how Nanda has sense portals guarded [by mindfulness]

_Tatiradaṃ bhikkhave nandassa indriyesu guttadvāratāya hoti_

Bhikkhus, if Nanda looks at the eastern quarter, applying his whole mind to it,
he looks thereat reflecting:

_sace bhikkhave nandassa puratthimā disā āloketabbā hoti sabbaṃ cetasā
samannāharitvā nando puratthimaṃ disaṃ āloketi_

'Thus while I look to the eastern quarter, greed, dejection, and unvirtuous,
spiritually unwholesome factors will not pursue me'

_evaṃ me puratthimaṃ disaṃ ālokayato na abhijjhā domanassā pāpakā
akusalā dhammā anvāssavissantī ti_

Thus indeed in this respect is he fully conscious

==== Renderings

- _capala_: fidgety

- _capala_: fluttery

- _capala_: puffed up

==== Introduction

===== Capala: two meanings

Opinion is divided regarding the meaning of _capala_.

- PED says: 'moving to and fro, wavering, trembling, unsteady, fickle.'

- Bodhi says: vain (A.3.391); personally vain (M.1.470);

- Norman says: vain (Th.v.157); unsteady (Dh.v.33).

Thus PED says movement, Bodhi says vanity, and Norman says both. And so do we,
but in three words: fidgety, fluttery, and puffed up.

===== Introduction: uddhacca and capala

Both _uddhata_ and _capala_ which frequently occur together, have double
meanings. See Glossary sv _Uddhacca_. Their double meanings mirror each other,
and can grouped as follows:

Group 1:

- _uddhata_: restless

- _capala_: fidgety/ fluttery

Group 2:

- _uddhata_: vain

- _capala_: puffed up

- _camma_: fascia

- _camma_: hide

- _camma_: an animal's skin

- _camma_: leather

- _camma_: leather shield

- _camma_: leather soundboard

==== Introduction

===== Chavi and camma: human skin and fascia

_Chavi_ and _camma_ are the superficial and deep layers of human integument. In
translation they are usually called 'outer skin' and 'inner skin.' We will show
that in humans:

1. _chavi_ is skin

2. _camma_ is fascia.

Fascia lies below skin. Fascia is not skin.

===== Cammi: animal hide

In animals, _cammi_ is equivalent to English 'hide' because it means not only
the skin of the living animal, but also the leather produced from that skin.
Animals do not have _chavi_. In animals, hair grows on _cammi_; in humans it
grows on _chavi_.

[quote, A.2.114]
____
Again, one kind of noble thoroughbred horse is not quickened nor does it
acquire an earnest attitude [to its work] when it sees the shadow of the goad,
nor when its hairs (_loma_) are struck by the goad, nor when its hide (_camma_)
is struck by the goad. Only when its bone is struck by the goad is it quickened
and it acquires an earnest attitude [to its work].

_Puna ca paraṃ bhikkhave idhekacco bhadro assājānīyo na heva kho
patodacchāyaṃ disvā saṃvijjati saṃvegaṃ āpajjati napi
lomavedhaviddho saṃvijjati saṃvegaṃ āpajjati. Napi cammavedhaviddho

saṃvijjati saṃvegaṃ āpajjati._

[quote, Vin.1.218]
____
At the moment the Blessed One saw her, that extensive wound was healed, and
(her thigh became covered in) healthy skin (_chavi_) with hairs (_loma_)
growing on it.

____

===== Integumentary system

The integumentary system is the two layers that cover human bodies. The outer
layer is 'skin,' and the inner layer is called by anatomists either:

1. subcutaneous tissue, or

2. hypodermis, or

3. superficial fascia.

'Skin' is comprised of epidermis and dermis. In animals, dermis, the lower part
of skin, is the source of leather. Dermis rests on superficial fascia.

If skin is removed, it leaves superficial fascia (or 'hypodermis' or
'subcutaneous tissue'). This superficial fascia is the lowermost layer of the
integumentary system.

===== Anatomical dissection of the integumentary system

In the anatomical dissection of the integumentary system, skin is first
stripped from superficial fascia. Consider these quotes:

- 'Incisions will be made on the back, and four large flaps of skin will be
reflected laterally, exposing an underlying fatty layer known as superficial
fascia' (http:// wings.buffalo.edu/smbs/ana/first.htm).

- 'Place the cat on its ventral surface. Massage the skin of the dorsal neck
region to separate it from the underlying muscles and make a small longitudinal
slit through the skin in the midline. Do not cut through the superficial fascia
under the skin' (http:// core.ecu.edu/biol/singhasc/cat-muscles.htm).

References:

(http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcutaneous_tissue).

(http:// en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Human_Physiology/Integumentary_System).

===== Dissection of the integumentary system by Prince Pāyāsi

Prince Pāyāsi dissected the integumentary system like this:

[quote, D.2.338]
____
Then I tell them to strip away the man's skin (_chaviṃ_), and perhaps we
shall see his soul emerging. They do so, but we do not see any soul emerging.
Then I tell them to strip away his fascia (_cammaṃ_), and perhaps we shall
see his soul emerging.

_Tyāhaṃ evaṃ vadāmi tena hi bho imassa purisassa chaviṃ chindatha
appevanāmassa jīvaṃ passeyyāmā ti. Te tassa purisassa chaviṃ chindanti
nevassa mayaṃ jīvaṃ passāma. Tyāhaṃ evaṃ vadāmi tena hi bho imassa
purisassa cammaṃ chindatha appevanāmassa jīvaṃ passeyyāmā ti._
____

===== Three types of fascia

Superficial fascia is the connective tissue and fat under skin. It is attached
to deep fascia and visceral fascia. Fascia is therefore of three types:

1. superficial fascia: underlies skin (=hypodermis or subcutaneous tissue).

2. deep fascia: surrounds muscles, bones, nerves and blood vessels.

3. visceral fascia: suspends organs within their cavities.

Fascia has been called 'the biological fabric that holds us together.'

In this Glossary we call superficial fascia 'fascia,' because it is obvious
which fascia we mean.

Reference: www. anatomytrains.com/fascia.

===== Leather: dermis not fascia

Like humans, animal integument has these layers:

1. epidermis (1% of integument thickness)

2. dermis (85% of integument thickness)

3. fascia (14% of integument thickness)

To produce leather:

1. The epidermis with hair and fur is removed (except by furriers).

2. The fascia is removed.

3. The dermis is processed to obtain leather.

Stripping epidermis from dermis is a complicated process.

Reference: www. leatherresource.com/whatisleather.html.

===== Camma: leather goods

_Camma_ ('hide') and _cammakhaṇḍaṃ_ ('piece of hide') are sometimes used
as the name of leather objects. For example, _camma_ can mean 'leather shield'
or 'leather soundboard.' _Cammakhaṇḍa_ can mean 'leather bucket'
(Vin.2.122) or 'leather mat' (Vin.4.41).

===== Taco

_Taca_ is practically equivalent to _chavi_ (i.e. comprised of epidermis plus
dermis):

===== The four paths to psychic power

The four paths to psychic power are:

- _chandasamādhi-padhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ_
- _viriyasamādhi-padhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ_
- _cittasamādhi-padhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ_
- _vīmaṃsāsamādhi-padhānasaṅkhārasamannāgataṃ iddhipādaṃ_

===== Developing the four paths to psychic power

The _Chanda Sutta_ (S.5.268) says that to develop these four paths one must
first develop the four _samādhis_:

- _chandasamādhi_
- _viriyasamādhi_
- _cittasamādhi_
- _vīmaṃsāsamādhi_

===== Cittasamādhi = dhammasamādhi

The _Pāṭaliya Sutta_ (S.4.350-2) shows that _cittasamādhi_ is synonymous
with _dhammasamādhi_

[quote, S.4.352]
____
'This is _dhammasamādhi_. If you were to obtain _cittasamādhi_ in this way,
you would abandon that state of unsureness.'

_Ayaṃ kho so gāmaṇi dhammasamādhī tatra ce tvaṃ cittasamādhiṃ
paṭilabheyyāsi evaṃ tvaṃ imaṃ kaṅkhādhammaṃ pajaheyyāsi._
____

===== Cittasamādhi: inward collectedness based on reflection

The _Pāṭaliya Sutta_ (S.4.351-2) concerns the development of
_dhammasamādhi_ through reflecting on one's virtue. See Illustrations below.
Therefore our renderings are:

- _dhammasamādhi_: inward collectedness based on righteous reflection

- _cittasamādhi_: inward collectedness based on reflection

===== Citta = ceto

In some of the illustrations we take for granted the equivalence of _citta_ and
_ceto_, as confirmed in PED sv _ceto_.

him he should overcome unsureness through the inward collectedness attained by
reflecting on virtuousness as follows:

[quote, S.4.351-2]
____
-- 'I harm no one at all, whether weak or strong. In both respects I have made
a lucky throw: since I am restrained in conduct of body, speech, and mind, and
since, with the demise of the body at death, I will be reborn in the realm of
happiness, in the heavenly worlds.'

_sohaṃ na kiñci vyābādhemi tasaṃ vā thāvaraṃ vā. Ubhayamettha

'[As he reflects thus] gladness arises. In one who is glad, rapture arises. For
one whose mind is rapturous, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he
experiences physical pleasure. Experiencing physical pleasure, his mind becomes
collected.

_tassa pāmojjaṃ jāyati pamuditassa pīti jāyati pītimanassa kāyo

'This, headman, is inward collectedness based on righteous reflection.

=== Cittaṃ pariyādāya tiṭṭhati

==== Renderings

- _cittaṃ pariyādāya tiṭṭhati_: to plague the mind

- _cittaṃ pariyādāya tiṭṭhati_: obsess the mind

==== Introduction

===== Pariyādāti and pariyādiyati

_Pariyādāti_ means 'to exhaust,' 'to consume,' 'to destroy,' and 'to
overcome.' See Illustrations.

_Pariyādiyati_ is the passive of _pariyādāti_, but both verbs have an active
sense. Thus PED says both mean 'to exhaust.'

===== Cittaṃ pariyādāya tiṭṭhati

Knowing the meaning of _pariyādāti_ is of no avail in the search for the
meaning of _cittaṃ pariyādāya tiṭṭhati_, which is to be discerned
through context. We use two phrases:

1. 'plague the mind'

2. 'obsess the mind'

We regard mental states as 'plaguing' the mind, and sensations as 'obsessing'
it.

==== Illustrations: pariyādāti, pariyādiyati

===== Pariyādāti: to exhaust

=== Cetanā; Ceteti

==== Renderings

- _cetanā_: intentionality

- _cetanā_: aspiration

- _cetanā_: intention

- _ceteti_: to be intent upon

- _ceteti_: to act intentionally

- _ceteti_: to aspire

- _cetayitvā_: in applying intention

==== Introduction

===== Intention and intentionality

_Cetanā_ can mean either intention or intentionality.

- Intention means not 'action' but 'delayed action.' 'Intending to act' means
acting later, if at all.

- Intentionality concerns the application of intention.

The difference between intention and intentionality is crucial in relation to
_kamma_, where it is said:

[quote, A.3.415]
____
Intentionality is karmically consequential conduct, I declare.

_Cetanāhaṃ bhikkhave kammaṃ vadāmi._
____

Having the intention to make merit or demerit is action by way of the mind
only, whereas intentionality concerns all three modes: body, speech, and mind.

===== Ceteti: to act intentionally

This quote illustrates _ceteti_'s meaning 'to act intentionally.'

[quote, M.1.377]
____
-- When pacing back and forth one brings about the death of many small beings.
What karmic consequence does the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe for this?

_so abhikkamanto paṭikkamanto bahū khuddake pāṇe saṅghātaṃ
āpādeti. Imassa pana gahapati nigaṇṭho nātaputto kaṃ vipākaṃ
paññāpetī ti_

-- The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta does not declare what is unintentional as
greatly blameworthy.

_Asañcetanikaṃ bhante nigaṇṭho nātaputto no mahāsāvajjaṃ
paññāpetī ti._

-- But what if one does it intentionally?

_Sace pana gahapati cetetī ti._

-- Then it is greatly blameworthy.

_Mahāsāvajjaṃ bhante hotī ti._

-- But under which [of the three categories] does the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta
place intentionality?

_Cetanaṃ pana gahapati nigaṇṭho nātaputto kismiṃ paññāpetī ti._

-- Under the mental category, bhante.

_Manodaṇḍasmiṃ bhante ti._
____

===== On absolutives

_Cetayitvā_ is an absolutive, the most common connective in Pāli, being
almost equivalent to the word 'and,' says Duroiselle. It usually denotes one
action completed before another, and so may be translated by the word 'having'
followed by a past participle, for example _gantvā_, 'having gone' (PGPL, para
618, i).

But the absolutive can sometimes be treated as a present participle. For
example: _idha āgantvā ahaṃ coraṃ passiṃ_ whilst coming here I saw a
thief (PGPL, para 618, vi). The present participle may generally be translated
by 'while, whilst,' thereby expressing contemporaneity of action (PGPL, para
619, i). For example, consider this quote:

[quote, M.2.138]
____
The Buddha does not sit while grasping his chin with his hand

_na ca pāṇinā hanukaṃ upādiyitvā nisīdati._
____

_Upādiyitvā_ must be treated as a present participle, otherwise the sentence
reads 'He sits down having not grasped his chin with his hand.'

===== Cetayitvā

The word _cetayitvā_ occurs just once in the scriptures: _cetayitvā kammaṃ
karoti kāyena vācāya manasā_ (A.3.415). Taken as a present participle, it
reads:

- In applying intention, one undertakes karmically consequential conduct by way
of body, speech, or mind.

But if taken as a classical 'having' absolutive, the sentence says:

- Having intended, one undertakes conduct by way of body, speech, or mind.

This would suggest that deeds follow a preceding intention, which is not
necessarily so. Having intended, one may not act accordingly. 'I intended to
make merit' does not mean I actually did so. Therefore _cetayitvā_ means 'in
applying intention,' as we have said.

Where, Puṇṇa, there is the intentionality to abandon karmically
consequential conduct that is dark with dark karmic consequences, or bright
with bright karmic consequences, or dark-and-bright with dark-and-bright karmic
consequences

_yamidaṃ kammaṃ kaṇhaṃ kaṇhavipākaṃ tassa pahānāya yā

karmically consequential conduct.

Horner: 'Where, Puṇṇa, there is the will to get rid of that deed that is
dark... bright... dark-and-bright... .' Horner's rendering of tatra is crucial.

bright... dark-and-bright... .'

=== Cetovimutti; Paññāvimutti

==== Renderings

- _cetovimutti_: liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]

- _cetovimutti_: liberation [from attachment through inward calm]

- _paññāvimutti_: liberation [from uninsightfulness] through penetrative
discernment

==== Introduction

===== Cetovimutti (when without paññāvimutti)

In contexts without _paññāvimutti_, _cetovimutti_ means 'liberation [from
perceptually obscuring states].' This can be demonstrated in two steps:

1. _Cetovimutti_ means freedom from attachment, hatred, and undiscernment of
reality.
+
[quote, S.4.296-7]
____
Now that unshakeable liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] is void of
attachment, void of hatred, void of undiscernment of reality.

_sā kho panākuppā cetovimutti suññā rāgena suññā dosena suññā
mohena._
____

2. Freedom from attachment, hatred, and undiscernment of reality means
liberation from perceptually obscuring states:

[quote, S.5.8]
____
The elimination of attachment, hatred, and undiscernment of reality: the
destruction of perceptually obscuring states is spoken of in that way.

_rāgavinayo dosavinayo mohavinayo ti āsavānaṃ khayo tena vuccatī ti._
____

===== Cetovimutti: often not arahantship

_Cetovimutti_ usually does not mean arahantship:

[quote, D.3.248]
____
If the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill is developed and cultivated, it is impossible, out
of the question, that ill will would plague your mind.

_Aṭṭhānametaṃ āvuso anavakāso yaṃ mettāya cetovimuttiyā
bhāvitāya bahulīkatāya... atha ca panassa vyāpādo cittaṃ pariyādāya
ṭhassatī ti._
____

Where it does mean arahantship, it is called unshakeable (_akuppā
cetovimutti_). See next paragraph.

===== Cetovimutti: temporary or permanent

_Cetovimutti_ may mean temporary or permanent liberation [from perceptually
obscuring states]:

[quote, S.1.120]
____
Then Venerable Godhika, abiding diligently, vigorously, and resolutely applied
[to the practice] attained temporary liberation [from perceptually obscuring
states]. But then Venerable Godhika fell away from that temporary liberation
[from perceptually obscuring states].

_Atha kho āyasmā godhiko appamatto ātāpī pahitatto viharanto sāmayikaṃ
cetovimuttiṃ phusi. Atha kho āyasmā godhiko tāya sāmayikāya
cetovimuttiyā parihāyi._
____

[quote, D.3.272-3]
____
Which one thing should be realised? Unshakeable liberation [from perceptually
obscuring states].

_Katamo eko dhammo sacchikātabbo? Akuppā cetovimutti._
____

===== Cetovimutti plus paññāvimutti

When _cetovimutti_ occurs with _paññāvimutti_ it has a different
meaning. _Paññāvimutti_ never occurs without _cetovimutti_, so has a single
meaning. Here we will consider their meanings when they occur together, in the
light of the eleventh _Bālavaggo_ sutta, where they correspond to _samatha_
and _vipassanā_:

[quote, A.1.61]
____
Two things are conducive to insightfulness into reality. Which two? Inward calm
and insightfulness.

_Dve me bhikkhave dhammā vijjābhāgiyā. Katame dve? Samatho ca vipassanā ca._

When inward calm is developed, what benefit accrues? The mind is developed.

_Samatho bhikkhave bhāvito kamatthamanubhoti? Cittaṃ bhāvīyati._

When the mind is developed, what benefit accrues? Attachment is abandoned.

_Cittaṃ bhāvitaṃ kamatthamanubhoti? Yo rāgo so pahīyati._

When insightfulness is developed, what benefit accrues? Penetrative discernment
is developed.

_Vipassanā bhikkhave bhāvitā kamatthamanubhoti? Paññā bhāvīyati._

When penetrative discernment is developed, what benefit accrues?
Uninsightfulness into reality is abandoned.

_Paññā bhāvitā kamatthamanubhoti? Yā avijjā sā pahīyati._

The mind that is defiled by attachment is not liberated [from perceptually
obscuring states].

_Rāgupakkiliṭṭhaṃ vā bhikkhave cittaṃ na vimuccati._

Penetrative discernment that is defiled by uninsightfulness into reality is not
developed.

_Avijjupakkiliṭṭhā vā paññā na bhāvīyati._

Therefore the liberation [from attachment] by [developing] the mind [in inward
calm] is due to the fading away of attachment.

_Iti kho bhikkhave rāgavirāgā cetovimutti_

And the liberation [from uninsightfulness] by [developing] penetrative
discernment is due to the fading away of uninsightfulness into reality.

_avijjāvirāgā paññāvimuttī ti._
____

On the basis of this sutta this we render the terms as:

- _Cetovimutti_: liberation [from attachment through inward calm]

- _Paññāvimutti_: liberation [from uninsightfulness] through penetrative
discernment

===== Cetovimuttiṃ plus paññāvimuttiṃ: not necessarily arahantship

The combination of _cetovimuttiṃ_ and _paññāvimuttiṃ_ may or may not
imply arahantship:

[quote, A.5.139]
____
Some person is unvirtuous but he discerns according to reality, with the
liberation [from attachment through inward calm] and the liberation [from
uninsightfulness] through penetrative discernment, where that unvirtuousness
ceases without remainder.

_Idha panānanda ekacco puggalo dussīlo hoti tañca cetovimuttiṃ
paññāvimuttiṃ yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti yatthassa taṃ dussīlyaṃ
aparisesaṃ nirujjhati._
____

[quote, "A.1.234, M.1.34"]
____
He, in this very lifetime, through the destruction of perceptually
obscuring states, enters upon and abides in the liberation [from attachment
through inward calm] and the liberation [from uninsightfulness] through
penetrative discernment, realising it for himself through transcendent insight.

_So āsavānaṃ khayā anāsavaṃ cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ
diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā upasampajja viharati_
____

===== Ubhatobhāgavimutto; Paññāvimutto; Paññāvimuttin; Cetovimuttin

For discussion of these terms see Glossary sv _Ubhatobhāgavimutto_.

- _ubhatobhāgavimutto_: one who is liberated [from perceptually obscuring
states] both through [penetrative discernment and through attaining the
immaterial states of awareness]

- _paññāvimutto_: one who is liberated [from perceptually obscuring states]
through penetrative discernment

- _paññāvimuttin_: one who is liberated [from uninsightfulness] through
penetrative discernment

_Katañcava bhikkhave asaṃvaro hoti._

In this regard, in seeing a visible object via the visual sense, a bhikkhu is
intent upon an agreeable visible object and troubled by a disagreeable visible
object.

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā piyarūpe rūpe adhimuccati
appiyarūpe rūpe vyāpajjati_

He abides without having established mindfulness of the body, with a small
mind, and he does not discern according to reality, with the liberation [from
attachment through inward calm] and the liberation [from uninsightfulness]
through penetrative discernment, where those unvirtuous, spiritually
unwholesome factors cease without remainder.

The perception of the unlastingness [of the five aggregates], the perception
that what is unlasting is existentially void, the perception that what is
existentially void is void of personal qualities, the perception of the
abandonment [of sensuous thoughts, unbenevolent thoughts, malicious thoughts,
and unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors], the perception of the passing

==== Introduction

===== Fondness vs. desire

One of the major divisions in meaning here is between fondness and desire. We
present fifteen or more examples of each to illustrate this division.

===== Chandasamādhi

_Chandasamādhi_ means inward collectedness based on desire. The idea that
inward collectedness can arise according to one's wishes is widely acknowledged
in the scriptures:

[quote, M.1.33]
____
Attain at will, without difficulty or trouble, the four jhānas, the higher
mental states which are pleasant states of meditation in this lifetime

_catunnaṃ jhānānaṃ ābhicetasikānaṃ diṭṭhadhammasukhavihārānaṃ
nikāmalābhī assaṃ akicchalābhī akasiralābhī ti._
____

[quote, M.1.207]
____
Whenever we want... we enter and abide in first jhāna

_yāvadeva ākaṅkhāma... paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharāma._
____

[quote, M.1.214]
____
A bhikkhu wields power over his mind; his mind does not wield power over him;
whatever abiding he wants to abide in in the morning, he does so.

_bhikkhu cittaṃ vasaṃ vatteti no ca bhikkhu cittassa vasena vattati. So
yāya vihārasamāpattiyā ākaṅkhati pubbanhasamayaṃ viharituṃ tāya
vihārasamāpattiyā pubbanhasamayaṃ viharati._
____

===== Chando: eagerness [to understand the teaching]

We parenthesise 'to understand the teaching' on the basis of the following
quote:

[quote, M.2.173]
____
-- 'But what quality is most helpful for enthusiastically applying oneself [to
the teaching]?'

_Ussāhassa pana bho gotama katamo dhammo bahukāro?_

-- 'Eagerness [to understand the teaching]. If eagerness [to understand the
teaching] did not arise, one wouldn't enthusiastically apply oneself [to the
teaching].'

_Ussāhassa kho bhāradvāja chando bahukāro. No cetaṃ chando jāyetha
nayidaṃ ussaheyya._

-- 'But what quality is most helpful for eagerness [to understand the
teaching]?'

_Chandassa pana bho gotama katamo dhammo bahukāro?_

-- 'The teaching receiving one's considered approval. If this did not happen,
eagerness [to understand the teaching] wouldn't arise.'

_Chandassa kho bhāradvāja dhammanijjhānakkhanti bahukārā. No cetaṃ
dhammanijjhānaṃ khameyyuṃ nayidaṃ chando jāyetha._

=== Jahāti orapāraṃ

==== Renderings

- _jahāti orapāraṃ_: he sheds the [ties to individual existence in the] low
plane of existence and the other planes beyond it

==== Introduction

===== The dictionaries: orapāra

The dictionaries (sv _Ora_) render _orapāra_ as follows:

- PED: 'the lower and higher worlds.'

- DOP: 'the nearer and the farther shore.'

We will now explain our support of PED.

===== Pāra and Apāra: then Pāra means nibbāna

Where _pāra_ means the Far Shore (i.e. _nibbāna_), then the Near Shore is
called _apāra_:

1. going from the Near Shore to the Far Shore
+
****
_apārā pāraṃ gamanāyāti_ (A.5.4).
****

2. He would go from the Near Shore to the Far Shore if he developed the Supreme
Way.
+
****
_Apārā pāraṃ gaccheyya bhāvetto maggamuttamaṃ_ (Sn.v.1130).
****

When _pāra_ is linked to _apāra_, it always means _nibbāna._ It does not
mean the far side of something. We can discount the single exception at Ud.90,
where people wanted to go to the far side of the Ganges: _apārā pāraṃ
gantukāmā_ (Ud.90). This can be regarded as a misquote because it is
contradicted by other versions of the same story:

****
_orā pāraṃ gantukāmā_ (D.2.89)
****

****
_orā pāraṃ gantukāmā_ (Vin.1.230).
****

===== Pāra and Ora: then Pāra does not mean nibbāna

When _pāra_ is paired with _ora_, then _pāra_ means the far side of
something, or further from the observer than something:

1. Unsatisfied with this side of the ocean, he would desire the other side as
well.
+
****
_Oraṃ samuddassa atittarūpo pāraṃ samuddassapi patthayetha_ (M.2.72).
****

The same relationship is seen with cognate words:

1. The foolish cowherd makes the cows cross 'without examining the near shore
(_orimaṃ tīraṃ_) or the far shore (_pārimaṃ tīraṃ_) of the river
Ganges'
+
****
_asamavekkhitvā gaṅgāya nadiyā orimaṃ tīraṃ asamavekkhitvā
pārimaṃ tīraṃ_ (M.1.225).
****

2. The village called Setakaṇṇika is in the southern direction. Beyond that
(_parā_) are border districts, nearer than that (_orato_) are middle
(districts).
+
****
_dakkhiṇāya disāya setakaṇṇikaṃ nāma nigamo. Tato parā paccantimā
janapadā orato majjhe_ (Vin.1.197).
****

3. Having taken the robe in one hand, and wiped the robe-rail or robe-cord with
the other hand, having got the edges away from him (_parato_), and the fold
towards him (_orato_), the robe should be laid aside.
+
****
_Cīvaraṃ nikkhipantena ekena hatthena cīvaraṃ gahetvā ekena hatthena
cīvaravaṃsaṃ vā cīvararajjuṃ vā pamajjitvā pārato antaṃ orato
bhogaṃ katvā cīvaraṃ nikkhipitabbaṃ_ (Vin.2.209).
****

===== Pāraṃ in the Uraga Sutta does not mean nibbāna

Translators of the _Uraga Sutta_ usually say that the bhikkhu 'abandons the
near and far shore'. For example, Norman says:

[quote, "Norman, Sn.v.1"]
____
That bhikkhu... leaves this shore and the far shore as a snake leaves its old,
worn-out skin.

_So bhikkhu jahāti orapāraṃ urago jiṇṇamiva tacaṃ purāṇaṃ._
____

Because 'far shore' implies _nibbāna_, we disagree with this translation for
two reasons:

1. _nibbāna_ is nowhere else said to be left or abandoned.

2. in combination with _oraṃ, pāraṃ_ means the far side of something, or
further from the observer than something, which are nowhere in the suttas said
to be qualities of _nibbāna_.

===== Verse 15: key to the meaning of orapāraṃ

The key to the meaning of _orapāraṃ_ is found in verse 15 which concerns the
non-returner. The verse says this:

[quote, Sn.v.15]
____
He in whom there is nothing born of suffering which is a cause for returning to
the low plane of existence (_oraṃ_), that bhikkhu sheds _orapāraṃ_, as a
snake sheds its old, worn-out skin.

_Yassa darathajā na santi keci oraṃ āgamanāya paccayāse +
So bhikkhu jahāti orapāraṃ urago jiṇṇamiva tacaṃ purāṇaṃ._
____

Here, in _oraṃ's_ first occurrence its meaning is clear: 'the low plane of
existence.' So let us now discuss the three planes of existence.

===== The three planes of existence

Each universe is comprised of three planes of existence (_dhātu_), which are
named according to two systems:

System 1)

[quote, D.3.215]
____
the low plane of existence, the middle plane of existence, and the high plane
of existence

_hīnadhātu majjhimadhātu paṇītadhātu._
____

System 2)

[quote, A.1.224]
____
the sensuous plane of existence, the refined material plane of existence, and
the immaterial plane of existence

_kāmadhātu... rūpadhātu... arūpadhātu._
____

Once-returners return once to this [low] plane of existence' (_sakideva imaṃ
lokaṃ āgantvā_, meaning the low plane of existence, _hīnadhātu_) because
they have not abandoned the five ties to individual existence in the low plane
of existence (_orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni_). Note that we render both
_hīna_ and _oraṃ_ as 'low.'

Non-returners do not return from 'that world' (_anāvattidhammo tasmā lokā_,
A.1.245) meaning the two higher planes of existence: the refined material plane
of existence (_rūpadhātu_) and the immaterial plane of existence
(_arūpadhātu_), because that is where they are reborn, either in the Pure
Abodes (M.1.81; A.4.73), or as Brahmās (S.1.149), or as immaterial beings
(A.2.127).

So _oraṃ_ in the phrase _orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni_ stands for
_hīnadhātu_, i.e. where non-returners do not return to. Therefore in
_orapāraṃ_, _pāraṃ_ stands for _majjhimadhātu_ and _paṇītadhātu_. If
shedding _oraṃ_ means abandoning the low plane of existence, then shedding
_pāraṃ_ means shedding the middle and high planes of existence. This, then,
gives us the meaning of _jahāti orapāraṃ:_

- He sheds the [ties to individual existence in the] low plane of existence and
the other planes beyond it.

The commentary explains _orapāra_ in several ways, one of which is: _Oraṃ
kāmadhātu, pāraṃ rūpārūpadhātu_. This confirms our explanation.

===== Parenthesis: '[ties to individual existence in the]'

Norman translation says:

[quote, "Norman, Sn.v.1"]
____
That bhikkhu... leaves this shore and the far shore as a snake leaves its old,
worn-out skin.

_So bhikkhu jahāti orapāraṃ urago jiṇṇamiva tacaṃ purāṇaṃ._
____

But one cannot rationally say one leaves what one does not have, in this case
the far shore. The commentary to verse 1 says it means _saṃyojanāni_ is
abandoned:

- _So bhikkhu jahāti orapāranti so evaṃ kodhaṃ vinento bhikkhu yasmā
kodho tatiyamaggena sabbaso pahīyati, tasmā orapārasaññitāni
pañcorambhāgiyasaṃyojanāni jahātīti veditabbo_

We parenthesise accordingly.

==== Introduction

===== Kālāma Sutta: yadā attanāva jāneyyātha

The _Kālāma Sutta_'s notoriety as the 'freethinker's kit to truth' is partly
due to a frequent mistranslation of the prominent phrase in the sutta by
ignoring the optative tense, thus:

[quote, A.1.190]
____
When you know for yourselves: 'These things are unwholesome... then you should
abandon them.

_Yadā tumhe kālāmā attanāva jāneyyātha ime dhammā akusalā... atha
tumhe kālāmā pajaheyyātha._
____

This flawed instruction would only be valid if the Buddha trusted an untrained
disciple to know for himself what is unwholesome and wholesome. But if he could
be trusted in this way, it would negate the rationale for a religious training
system. We propose that the excerpt is more accurately and more rationally
translated with 'should consider.' The context obliges one to translate _yadā_
as 'if' not 'when':

[quote, A.1.190]
____
Kālāmas, if you yourselves should consider: "These teachings are
unwholesome... you should abandon them.

_Yadā tumhe kālāmā attanāva jāneyyātha ime dhammā akusalā... atha

____

===== Saṅkhitta Sutta: jāneyyāsi

In the _Saṅkhitta Sutta jāneyyāsi_ is a synonym of _dhāreyyāsi_, both
words in the optative tense, and both with the meaning 'to consider,' not 'to
know'.

[quote, A.4.280]

==== Introduction

===== PED's terms for Jāla and Jālin

PED (sv _Jāla_) says: 'a net; netting, entanglement (lit. or fig.): snare,
deception.'

PED (sv _Jālin_) says:

\a) adj: "having a net," ensnaring, deceptive

\b) noun: a fisherman, ensnarer, witch

===== Taṇhā: entanglement

We call _taṇhā_ an entanglement not a net for two reasons:

1. _Taṇhā_ is a synonym of _saṅghāṭa_, which is 'a weft, tangle, mass,'
says PED, and means literally 'binding together.'
+

===== Venerable Surādha's 'entanglement'

Venerable Surādha said:

[quote, Th.v.135]
____
Birth is destroyed by me. The Conqueror's training system has been fulfilled.
What is considered 'the entanglement' has been abandoned [by me]. The conduit
to renewed states of individual existence has been abolished.

_Khīṇā hi mayhaṃ jāti vusitaṃ jinasāsanaṃ +

_Jālasaṅkhāto_ ("considered 'the entanglement'") could be pointing to
_mohajālaṃ_ (S.3.83), _maccuno jālaṃ_ (Sn.v.357), or _taṇhājālo_
(Th.v.308). But the association with _bhavanetti_ means _taṇhājālo_ is
likely meant, because _taṇhā_ is part of _bhavanetti_:

[quote, S.3.191]
____
The fondness, attachment, spiritually fettering delight, craving, clinging,
grasping, obstinate adherence, stubborn attachment, and identification in
regards to bodily form: this is called the conduit to renewed states of
individual existence.

_rūpe kho rādha yo chando yo rāgo yā nandi yā taṇhā ye upayūpādānā

Although _taṇhā_ is usually 'destroyed' or 'obliterated,' it is also said to
be 'abandoned':

1. _Yā taṇhā ye upayupādānā cetaso adhiṭṭhānābhinivesānusayā te
tathāgatassa pahīnā_ (S.3.10).

=== Ñāṇa

==== Renderings

- _ñāṇa_: knowledge

- _ñāṇa_: knowledge [of things according to reality]

- _ñāṇa_: perception (_Poṭṭhapāda Sutta_)

- _aññāṇa_: ignorance

- _aññāṇa_: ignorance [of things according to reality]

- _aññāṇa_: incomprehension

==== Introduction

===== Ñāṇa: factual knowledge or insightful knowledge

_Ñāṇa_ is derived from _jānāti_ and means either factual knowledge or
insightful knowledge. Factual knowledge is the knowledge of someone looking
into a well and knowing, 'There is water' (_tassa udakan ti hi kho ñāṇaṃ
assa_ S.2.118). Insightful knowledge is knowing, for example, old age and death
according to reality (_jarāmaraṇe yathābhūtaṃ ñāṇāya_ S.2.132).

Thus to indicate insightful knowledge, _yathābhūtaṃ_ is used, at least
sometimes. Where it is missing, it should be parenthesised.

===== Aññāṇa: lack of factual knowledge or insightful knowledge

Correspondingly, there are the opposites: lack of factual knowledge and lack
insightful knowledge. The former is the ignorance (_aññāṇa_) that a
bhikkhu might have of a Pātimokkha rule, and who exclaims 'Only now do I
realise! This regulation, it seems, is handed down as a Pātimokkha rule'
(Vin.4.144). The latter is, for example, of the first noble truth: ignorance of
suffering [according to reality] (_dukkhe aññāṇaṃ_ S.5.430).

Here we have parenthesised [according to reality] to indicate insightful
knowledge. This is clearly justified because in other suttas, _yathābhūtaṃ_
is associated with the formula: _So idaṃ dukkhan ti yathābhūtaṃ
pajānāti_ (S.5.199).

===== Parenthesising: association of terms

Our parenthesis is also justified because of the association of _ñāṇa_ with
terms where we have explained that a similar parenthesis is used:

1. _dassana_: vision [of things according to reality].
+
****
He has knowledge and vision of all phenomena [according to reality],

_Sabbesu dhammesu ca ñāṇadassī_ (Sn.v.478).

See Glossary sv _Dassana_.
****

2. _ñatvā_: knowing [according to reality].
+
****
One who is uncertain [about the significance of the teaching] should train
in the path of knowledge [of things according to reality], [for these] things
have been spoken of by the Ascetic having [likewise] known them [according to
reality].

_Kathaṅkathī ñāṇapathāya sikkhe ñatvā pavuttā samaṇena dhammā_ (Sn.v.868).

See Glossary sv _Ñatvā_.
****

===== Poṭṭhapāda Sutta: unusual

The use of _ñāṇaṃ_ in the _Poṭṭhapāda Sutta_ is unusual. It will be
discussed in the Illustrations.

Bhikkhus, whatsoever is the knowledge of suffering [according to reality], of

perception (Poṭṭhapāda Sutta)
====

The use of _ñāṇaṃ_ in the _Poṭṭhapāda Sutta_ is unusual. The Buddha
tells Poṭṭhapāda that:

[quote, D.1.185]
____
'A state of refined awareness arises first, perception [of that state]
afterwards. From the arising of a state of refined awareness comes the
perception [of that state]. Thus one knows that perception has a specific and
necessary condition.'

_Saññā kho poṭṭhapāda paṭhamaṃ uppajjati pacchā ñāṇaṃ.
Saññuppādā ca pana ñāṇuppādo hoti. So evaṃ pajānāti idappaccayā
kira me ñāṇaṃ udapādī ti._
____

COMMENT

Poṭṭhapāda's question stemmed from the Buddha's explanation of how various
states of refined awareness (_saññā_) arise, and how there is a 'subtle but
true perception' of those states (_sukhumasaccasaññā tasmiṃ samaye hoti_).
Thus _saññā_ has two meanings: state of refined awareness, and perception of
that state. For example:

[quote, D.1.183-4]
____
Further, Poṭṭhapāda, with the overcoming in every way of the state of
awareness of boundless space, a bhikkhu enters and abides in the state of
awareness of boundless mental consciousness, where one perceives that mental
consciousness is boundless.

_Puna ca paraṃ poṭṭhapāda bhikkhu sabbaso ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ
samatikkamma anantaṃ viññāṇan ti viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ upasampajja
viharati._

(...) And for him the previous subtle but true perception (_saññā_) of the
state of awareness of boundless space ceases. And at that time there is a
subtle but true perception (_saññā_) of the state of awareness of boundless
mental consciousness. He is one with a subtle but true perception of the state
of awareness of boundless mental consciousness.

_Tassa yā purimā ākāsānañcāyatanasukhumasaccasaññā sā nirujjhati.
Viññāṇañcāyatanasukhumasaccasaññā tasmiṃ samaye hoti.
Viññāṇañcāyatanasukhumasaccasaññī yeva tasmiṃ samaye hoti._

(...) In this way one state of refined awareness (_saññā_) arises through
the training, and one state of refined awareness (_saññā_) ceases through
the training.

_Evampi sikkhā ekā saññā uppajjati. Sikkhā ekā saññā nirujjhati_
____

Now, following the Buddha's explanation, Poṭṭhapāda wanted to know the
relationship between states of refined awareness and perception of those
states. This was because he had recently attended discussions on the 'thorough
ending of states of refined awareness' (_abhisaññānirodhe_) in which
philosophers had explained the relationship beween the two. For instance, one
philosopher said states of refined awareness (_saññā_) arise and cease
without indispensible or necessary conditions (_ahetū appaccayā purisassa
saññā uppajjanti pi nirujjhanti pi_). When they arise, one is perceptive [of
them] (_Yasmiṃ samaye uppajjanti saññī tasmiṃ samaye hoti_), when they
disappear, one is unperceptive [of them] (_Yasmiṃ samaye nirujjhanti
asaññī tasmiṃ samaye hotī ti_). But in asking which comes first, states
of refined awareness or perception of those states, Poṭṭhapāda would have
needed to ask, 'Which comes first, _saññā_ or _saññā_?' To avoid this
situation, he called perception '_ñāṇaṃ_.' The Buddha accepted this
substitution and gave the answer above, adding that perception has a specific
and necessary condition (_idappaccayā kira me ñāṇaṃ udapādī_).

- _ñāya_: the correct approach

- _ñāya dhamma_: the noble practice

- _ariya ñāya_: the noble practice

- _ariya ñāya_: the noble doctrine

==== Introduction

===== Ñāya: noble practice

_Ñāya_ occurs either alone or with _ariyo_ or _dhamma_. These words mean:

- _ñāya_: 'noble practice'

- _ariyo_: 'noble'

- _dhamma_: 'practice'

Therefore any combination of these words usually means 'the noble practice.'
But if _ñāya_ means 'noble practice,' and _dhamma_ means 'practice,' then
_dhamma_ is redundant.

[quote, A.2.37]
____
He explained the noble practice which is of benefit to devas and men

_Hitaṃ devamanussānaṃ ñāyaṃ dhammaṃ pakāsayī._
____

[quote, S.5.19]
____
He fulfils the noble practice that is spiritually wholesome.

_ārādhako hoti ñāyaṃ dhammaṃ kusalan ti._
____

Bodhi incorporates the redundancy by using a comma:

[quote, "Bodhi, A.2.37"]
____
He revealed the Dhamma, the method, for the benefit of devas and humans

_Hitaṃ devamanussānaṃ ñāyaṃ dhammaṃ pakāsayī._
____

[quote, "Bodhi, S.5.19"]
____
He attains the method, the Dhamma that is wholesome.

_ārādhako hoti ñāyaṃ dhammaṃ kusalan ti._
____

===== The noble practice: definition

The noble practice means 'practices that are virtuous and spiritually
wholesome':

[quote, A.2.36]
____
He applies himself to the welfare and happiness of the manyfolk.

_bahujanahitāya paṭipanno hoti bahujanasukhāya_

(...) By him are many folk established in the noble practice, namely in the
aggregate of practices that are virtuous and spiritually wholesome.

_bahu'ssa janatā ariye ñāye patiṭṭhāpitā yadidaṃ kalyāṇadhammatā
kusaladhammatā._
____

Comments:

1. The -_tā_ suffix denotes multitude, collection (PGPL: para 581).

2. Whatever there is in my family that is suitable for offering, all that I
share unreservedly with those who are virtuous and of a virtuous moral nature.

===== Ñāya: 'correct approach'

A different meaning for _ñāya_ is indicated in the story about
Medakathālikā, the acrobat's apprentice (S.5.168) where it means 'correct
approach.' See Illustrations.

===== Ariyo ñāyo: the noble doctrine

_Ariyo ñāyo_ in reference to dependent origination (_paṭiccasamuppāda_
S.2.70) means 'noble doctrine':

____
'the noble doctrine that one has clearly seen and correctly penetrated by
penetrative discernment'

_ariyo ñāyo paññāya sudiṭṭho hoti suppaṭividdho_
____

_Ñāyo_ is properly called 'doctrine' because it is equivalent to _dhamma_
that the Buddha used, again in reference to dependent origination:

____
It is through not fathoming, not penetrating this doctrine that this generation
is tangled up like string

_etassa ānanda dhammassa ananubodhā appaṭivedhā evamayaṃ pajā
tantākulakajātā_
____

In both cases dependent origination is a doctrine to be penetrated.

- How is it to be obtained here... ? (CDB p.1645).

- How could I possibly think... ? (CDB p.666).

Our own threefold solution is as follows:

- How could it possibly be otherwise?

- What can be possibly done about it?

- What possible advantage is there in such a thought?

===== Relationship to an underlying truth

The validity of these renderings can be demonstrated by considering their
relationship to an underlying truth:

1. 'How could it possibly be otherwise?' arises from the truth that 'being
otherwise is impossible.' For example: What is born deteriorates: how could it
possibly be otherwise?

2. 'What can be possibly done about it?' arises from the truth that 'this is an
immutable fact.' For example: Originated phenomena are unlasting: what can be
possibly done about it?

3. 'What possible advantage is there in such a thought?' arises from the truth
that 'there is no possible advantage in such a thought.' For example, the
Buddha said a bhikkhu was unworthy to be a visitor of families (_arahati na
kulūpago hotuṃ_) if he did so with the thought that they should give him
offerings, because if they did not comply he would be resentful. He said that
the thought, 'May they give!' should be quelled with the thought, 'What
possible advantage is there in such a thought?'

===== The Dvedhāvitakka Sutta: a comparison

Eradicating unvirtuous thoughts by recognising their lack of usefulness is
described in a similar way in the _Dvedhāvitakka Sutta_ where the Buddha said
that before his enlightenment, when afflicted by sensuous thought, unbenevolent
thought, and malicious thought (_kāmavitakko; vyāpādavitakko;
vihiṃsāvitakko_) he would reflect on such thoughts:

[quote, M.1.114]
____
This leads to my own harm, the harm of others, the harm of both. It is
destructive of penetrative discernment, associated with distress, not conducive
to the Untroubled

_attavyābādhāyapi saṃvattati paravyābādhāyapi saṃvattati
ubhayavyābādhāyapi saṃvattati paññānirodhiko vighātapakkhiko

____

He said that by reflecting like this, the thought would vanish.

enjoying sensuous pleasure, being consumed by sensuous thought, tormented by
sensuous passion, eager in the quest for sensuous pleasure, could know or see

practice of unsensuousness? It is impossible' (_netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati_)

resentment.

_anatthamme acarīti... caratīti... carissatīti āghātaṃ bandhati_

He has harmed, is harming, or will harm someone beloved and dear to me.
Thinking thus, one arouses resentment.

_Piyassa me manāpassa anatthaṃ acarīti... caratīti... carissatīti
āghātaṃ bandhati_

He has benefited, is benefiting, or will benefit someone who is unbeloved or
loathsome to me. Thinking thus, one arouses resentment.

_Appiyassa me amanāpassa atthaṃ acari... carati... carissatīti āghātaṃ
bandhati_

And tenthly, one is groundlessly irritated.

_aṭṭhāne ca kuppati._
____

There are correspondingly ten ways of overcoming resentment, via the thought
_taṃ kutettha labbhāti,_ as follows:

- He has harmed, is harming, or will harm me. What possible advantage is there
in such a thought?

- He has harmed, is harming, or will harm someone beloved and dear to me. What
possible advantage is there in such a thought?

- He has benefited, is benefiting, or will benefit someone who is unbeloved or
loathsome to me. What possible advantage is there in such a thought?

Finally, one overcomes groundless irritation through being groundlessly
unirritated (_aṭṭhāne ca na kuppati_) (A.5.150).

=== Taṇhā

==== Renderings

- _taṇhā_: craving

- _bhavataṇhā_: craving for states of individual existence (i.e. treating
_bhavataṇhā_ as a plural)

- _vibhavataṇhā_: craving for the cessation of states of individual
existence (i.e. treating _vibhavataṇhā_ as a plural)

==== Introduction

===== Taṇhā is 'powerful and unsubdued'

_Taṇhā_ is usually and correctly called 'craving' (i.e. strong desire). This
is justified by comparison with _kāmarāgo_, which is a tie to individual
existence when it is 'powerful and unsubdued':

1. Craving is the seamstress. For craving stitches him to this or that state of
individual existence and rebirth.
+
****
_taṇhā sibbanī_. _Taṇhā hi naṃ sibbati tassa tasseva bhavassa
abhinibbattiyā_ (A.3.400).
****

2. When attachment to sensuous pleasure is powerful and unsubdued in him, it is
a tie to individual existence in the low plane of existence.
+
****
_tassa so kāmarāgo thāmagato appaṭivinīto orambhāgiyaṃ saṃyojanaṃ_
(M.1.433).
****

===== Taṇhā comes from misperceiving sense impression

_Taṇhā_ arises dependent on sense impression, as follows:

[quote, D.2.31]
____
When there is sense impression, craving arises. Craving arises dependent on
sense impression

_vedanāya kho sati taṇhā hoti vedanāpaccayā taṇhā ti._
____

How misperception of sense impression leads to craving is explained in the
_Sammasa Sutta_ as follows:

[quote, S.2.108-9]
____
Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and Brahmanists in the past... in the future...
at present regard that in the world which is agreeable and pleasing

_Ye hi ke ci bhikkhave atītamaddhānaṃ... anāgatamaddhānaṃ... etarahi
samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā yaṃ loke piyarūpaṃ sātarūpaṃ_

as lasting

_taṃ niccato passanti_

as existentially substantial

_sukhato passanti_

as endowed with personal qualities

_attato passanti_

as unailing

_ārogyato passanti_

as free of danger

_khemato passanti_

they nurture craving

_te taṇhaṃ vaḍḍhenti._
____

Therefore misperception produces _taṇhā_.

===== Bhavataṇhā and Vibhavataṇhā: plurals

There are three forms of _taṇhā_:

[quote, D.2.308]
____
craving for sensuous pleasure

_kāmataṇhā_

craving for states of individual existence

_bhavataṇhā_

craving for the cessation of states of individual existence

_vibhavataṇhā._
____

We treat _bhavataṇhā_ as a plural, in accordance with other suttas. For
example:

1. not free of craving for various states of individual existence
+
****
_avitataṇhāse bhavābhavesu_ (Sn.v.776).
****

2. In relation to states of individual existence, the attachment to individual
existence_._
+
****
_bhavesu bhavarāgo_ (A.2.10).
****

3. All these states of individual existence are unlasting, existentially void,
destined to change. On perceiving this according to reality with perfect
penetrative discernment he abandons craving for states of individual existence.
+
****
_Sabbe te bhavā aniccā dukkhā vipariṇāmadhammā_. +
_Evametaṃ yathābhūtaṃ sammappaññāya passato_ +
_Bhavataṇhā pahīyati_ (Ud.33).
****

We likewise treat _vibhavataṇhā_ as a plural, otherwise it would only be
applicable to the annihilationist ideal. Here, because some devas and men are
revolted, appalled, and disgusted by individual existence (_bhaveneva kho
paneke aṭṭiyamānā harāyamāsā jigucchamānā_), they long for the
cessation of individual existence (_vibhavaṃ abhinandanti_). They think:

[quote, It.44]
____
When that [absolute] Selfhood is annihilated, destroyed, and does not exist
with the demise of the body at death, this is peaceful, this is sublime, this
is reality.'

_yato kira bho ayaṃ attaṃ kāyassa bhedā parammaraṇā ucchijjati
vinassati na hoti parammaraṇā etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ etaṃ
yathāvantī._
____

However, through disgust with personal identity such people keep running and
circling around that same personal identity just as a dog bound by a leash tied
to a firm post or pillar keeps on running and circling around that same post or
pillar (M.2.232-233).

This form of _taṇhā_ is no less a basis for renewed states of individual
existence than the other two forms. But treating _vibhavataṇhā_ as a plural
gives it a much broader application.

These plurals are therefore applicable in the following quotes:

[quote, D.3.216]
____
Three further types of craving

_Aparā pi tisso taṇhā_

craving for the sensuous plane of existence

_kāmataṇhā_

craving for the refined material plane of existence

_rūpataṇhā_

craving for the immaterial plane of existence.

_arūpataṇhā._
____

[quote, D.3.216]
____
Three further varietes of craving:

_aparā pi tisso taṇhā_

craving for refined material states of awareness

_rūpataṇhā_

craving for immaterial states of awareness

_arūpataṇhā_

craving for the ending [of originated phenomena]

_nirodhataṇhā._
____

===== Basis of the ego: Pārileyyaka Sutta

_Taṇhā_ creates egoistic ideas in the following way:

[quote, S.3.96]
____
The ignorant Everyman considers bodily form to be the [absolute] Selfhood

_rūpaṃ attato samanupassati_

That considering is an originated phenomenon

_yā kho pana sā bhikkhave samanupassanā saṅkhāro so_

What is the basis, origin, object of genesis and production of that originated
phenomenon?

_So pana saṅkhāro kinnidāno kiṃsamudayo kiñjātiko kimpabhavoti_

When the ignorant Everyman is affected by sense impression born of sensation
and uninsightfulness into reality, craving arises.

_avijjāsamphassajena bhikkhave vedayitena phuṭṭhassa assutavato
puthujjanassa uppannā taṇhā_

That originated phenomenon is born from that

_tatojo so saṅkhāro._
____

===== Basis of the ego: other suttas

That assumptions of Selfhood stem from _taṇhā_ is confirmed in other suttas:

1. The view that the Tathāgata exists after death is called a matter of
_taṇhā_ (_taṇhāgatametaṃ_) (A.4.69).

2. When ascetics and brahmans who are eternalists proclaim the eternity of the
Self and the world in four ways, that is merely merely the agitation and
trembling of those overcome by _taṇhā_ (_taṇhāgatametaṃ_) (D.1.40).

3. When the bhikkhu Sati had the view that 'it is this same consciousness that
runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not another', the Buddha said
that the bhikkhu Sati was caught up in the vast net of _taṇhā_ (M.1.271).

4. When the Buddha explained the doctrine of no-Self, and a monk asked what
Self will the actions done by not-Self affect, the Buddha said that the
bhikkhu's mind was overcome by _taṇhā_ (_taṇhādhipateyyena_) (M.3.19).

5. It is craving that produces a person;

Norman says the alternative reading _taṇhaṃ dukkhassa sambhavaṃ_
'probably arose from the inability of the scribes to fit the seeming nominative
_taṇhā_ into the structure of the sentence. This problem disappears when we
realise that _taṇhā_ is a truncated instrumental = _taṇhāya'_ (Group of
Discourses n.741). This view is supported by the commentary (which says _etaṃ
dukkhassa sambhavaṃ taṇhāya ādīnavaṃ ñatvā_) and also by the usual
meaning of _sambhava,_ which is 'arising' not 'origin.'

=== Tathāgata

==== Renderings

- _tathāgata_: the Perfect One

==== Introduction

===== Venerable Ñāṇamoli: 'Perfect One'

Ñāṇamoli translated _tathāgata_ as 'Perfect One' in all his translations:
the _Majjhima Nikāya_, the _Visuddhimagga_, the _Nettippakaranaṃ_, and the
_Life of the Buddha_. This term was restored to _Tathāgata_ when his
translation of the _Majjhima Nikāya_ was published as _A Treasury of the
Buddha's Words_, and later _The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha_.

===== Horner: 'Accomplished One or Perfect One'

Horner (_Middle Length Sayings_, Volume 1, xvii) says that _tathāgata_
probably means Accomplished One or Perfect One, but argues that these
renderings are inadequate because they have no etymological justification and
moreover are equally applicable to any arahant.

===== The Buddha ignored etymology

As for her former objection, the Buddha also ignored etymology. It is true that
he occasionally referred to _tathā_ (_yathāvādi tathākārī yathākārī
tathāvādī tasmā tathāgato ti vuccati_, D.3.135) which would justify the
word 'thus' in 'Thus Gone One.' But this hardly contradicts our assertion,
because firstly he always ignored the _gata_/_āgata_ suffix, and secondly some
of his explanations make no reference even to _tathā._ Therefore references to
_tathā_ should be seen as mere wordplay. For example when Queen Mallikā said:

[quote, M.2.108]
____
Perfect One's do not speak untruth

_na hi tathāgatā vitathaṃ bhaṇantī ti._
____

===== All arahants are tathāgatas

As for Horner's latter objection that 'Perfect One' cannot be used of the
Buddha because the term could equally applicable to any arahant, this argument
also fails because _tathāgata_ is indeed occasionally applied to all arahants,
for example at M.1.140:

[quote, M.1.140]
____
Bhikkhus, when the devas with Inda, Brahmā, and Pajāpati seek a bhikkhu who
is liberated in mind, they do not find [anything of which they could say]: 'The
stream of sense consciousness of the Perfect One is attached to this. For what
reason? The Perfect One is untraceable even in this lifetime, I declare.

_Evaṃ vimuttacittaṃ kho bhikkhave bhikkhuṃ saindā devā sabrahmakā
sapajāpatikā anvesaṃ nādhigacchanti idaṃ nissitaṃ tathāgatassa
viññāṇan ti. Taṃ kissa hetu? Diṭṭhevāhaṃ bhikkhave dhamme
tathāgataṃ ananuvejjoti vadāmi._
____

===== Different levels of perfection of the Perfect One

Even after his enlightenment the Buddha accepted the possibility of further
developing the aggregates of virtue, inward collectedness, penetrative
discernment, liberation [from perceptually obscuring states], and the knowledge
and vision that follows liberation [from perceptually obscuring states], and
said he would live under a teacher to do this:

[quote, S.1.139]
____
It would be for the sake of fulfilling the unfulfilled aggregate of virtuous
practices... the knowledge and vision that follows liberation [from
perceptually obscuring states] that I would honour, respect, and dwell under
another ascetic or brahman in spiritual discipleship.

_aparipuṇṇassa kho sīlakkhandhassa... samādhikkhandhassa...
paññākkhandhassa... vimuttikkhandhassa... vimuttiñāṇadassanakkhandhassa
pāripuriyā aññaṃ samaṇaṃ vā brāhmaṇaṃ vā sakkatvā garukatvā
upanissāya vihareyyaṃ._
____

This suggests the possibility of different levels of perfection, even at the
exalted level of Perfect Ones.

===== Different levels of perfection amongst Perfect Ones

Related to this is the possibility that different _tathāgatas_ are at
different levels of perfection. This was the basis of the Buddha's objection
when Venerable Sāriputta claimed that there never was, nor is, nor will be,
another ascetic or Brahmanist who has greater transcendent insight regarding
enlightenment than the Blessed One (_na cāhu na ca bhavissati na cetarahi
vijjati añño samaṇovā brāhmaṇo vā bhagavatā bhiyyobhiññataro
yadidaṃ sambodhiyanti_ (D.3.99).

The Buddha said such a statement would only be valid if one knew the minds of
all Buddhas, past, present and future (_atītānāgatapaccuppannesu arahantesu
sammāsambuddhesu cetopariyañāṇaṃ_ (D.3.100).

===== Absolute perfection: nibbāna

Although 'Perfect One' validly renders _tathāgata_, the Buddha did not claim
that he was therefore perfection itself. The Buddha was perfect in the terms in
which he described himself. Absolute perfection, _accantaniṭṭho_ is none
other than _nibbāna_ (M.1.252).

===== Tādin: 'one of excellent qualities'

The meaning of _tādin_ can usually be understood from the context. Where we
call it 'one of such good qualities,' it refers to qualities just mentioned.
Sometimes, however, there are no such qualities mentioned, and so we say 'one
of excellent qualities,' which is a natural development of the same idea. PED
calls this _tādin_'s 'pregnant sense.'

Other translators resolve the issue in similar ways. PED says _tādin_ means
'of such (good) qualities, "ecce homo"; in pregnant sense appl. to the
Bhagavant & Arahants.' Norman calls it 'the venerable one,' and explains 'The
word seems to mean "of such a kind = Buddha-like, or holy, venerable"' (Elders'
Verses n.41).

_Tādin_ is 'a reduction' of _tādisa_, says PED.

===== Brahman: tevijja, master of threefold Vedic knowledge

A brahman who is a 'master of the three Vedas' (_tiṇṇaṃ vedānaṃ
pāragū_) is called 'a master of threefold Vedic knowledge' (_tevijja_),
though the definition includes other qualities, as follows:

[quote, A.1.166]
____
-- 'In what way, brahman, do brahmans declare a brahman to be a master of
threefold Vedic knowledge?'

_Yathākathaṃ pana brāhmaṇa brāhmaṇā brāhmaṇaṃ tevijjaṃ
paññāpentī ti_

-- 'In this regard, Master Gotama, a brahman is of pure ancestry on both sides
of his family, of pure descent, unimpeachable and irreproachable with respect
to birth as far back as the seventh generation.

_Idha pana bho gotama brāhmaṇo ubhato sujāto hoti mātito ca pitito ca
saṃsuddhagahaṇiko yāva sattamā pitāmahāyugā akkhitto anupakkuṭṭho
jātivādena_

he is a scholar [of the sacred texts]

_ajjhāyako_

he knows by heart the sacred texts

_mantadharo_

he is a master of the three Vedas

_tiṇṇaṃ vedānaṃ pāragū_

together with its glossaries, rituals

_sanighaṇḍukeṭubhānaṃ_

phonology, etymology

_sākkharappabhedānaṃ_

and fifthly, the commentaries

_itihāsapañcamānaṃ_

he is fully versed in linguistics, grammar, natural philosophy, and in the
marks of a Great Man

_padako veyyākaraṇo lokāyatamahāpurisalakkhaṇesu anavayo_

In this way, Gotama, do brahmans declare a brahman to be a master of threefold
Vedic knowledge

_evaṃ kho bho gotama brāhmaṇā brāhmaṇaṃ tevijjaṃ paññāpentī
ti._
____

===== Arahant: tevijja, master of the three final knowledges

A bhikkhu who has attained the three final knowledges (_tisso vijjā_) is a
'master of the three final knowledges' (_tevijja_).

_Tisso vijjā_ are called the 'three final knowledges' because they were the
last knowledges to be realised before the Buddha's enlightenment.

[quote, D.3.275]
____
The three final knowledges are:

_Tisso vijjā_

the final knowledge: the knowledge through recalling of past lives

_pubbenivāsānussati ñāṇaṃ vijjā_

the final knowledge: knowledge of the transmigration of beings

_sattānaṃ cutūpapāte ñāṇaṃ vijjā_

the final knowledge: the knowledge of the destruction of perceptually obscuring
states_._

_āsavānaṃ khaye ñāṇaṃ vijjā._
____

==== Introduction: other meanings of vijjā

===== Vijjā: insightfulness into reality

_Vijjā_ is the opposite of _avijjā_ (uninsightfulness into reality). This is
dealt with sv _Avijjā_.

[quote, S.3.173-4]
____
The ignorant Everyman does not discern according to reality the origination,
vanishing, sweetness, wretchedness, and deliverance in regards to the five
aggregates.

_assutavā puthujjano rūpassa... viññāṇassa samudayañca atthaṅgamañca
assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti._

(...) This is called uninsightfulness into reality

_ayaṃ vuccatāvuso avijjā_

(...) The learned noble disciple discerns these matters according to reality

_sutavā ariyasāvako rūpassa... viññāṇassa assādañca ādīnavañca
nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti_

(...) This is called insightfulness into reality

_Ayaṃ vuccatāvuso vijjā._
____

===== Vijjā: occult knowledge

_Vijjā_ can mean 'occult knowledge.' For example, the householder Kevaḍḍha
suggested that if bhikkhus performed superhuman displays of psychic power, it
would win the faith of the unbelievers of Nāḷandā. The Buddha replied that
if a bhikkhu displayed various kinds of psychic power, someone with faith and
trust might see him doing so and tell someone who was sceptical and
unbelieving. And that man would say:

[quote, D.1.213-4]
____
'There is something called Gandhāra occult knowledge, by means of which he
wields various kinds of psychic power.

_atthi kho bho gandhārī nāma vijjā tāya so bhikkhu anekavihitaṃ
iddhividhaṃ paccanubhoti_

The Buddha concluded: 'Seeing this wretchedness in displays of psychic power, I
am revolted, appalled, and disgusted by them.'

_Imaṃ kho ahaṃ kevaḍḍha iddhipāṭihāriye ādīnavaṃ sampassamāno
iddhipāṭihāriyena aṭṭiyāmi harāyāmi jigucchāmi._
____

===== Tiracchānavijjā: base art

_Tiracchānavijjā_ means 'base art.' For example:

[quote, D.1.9]
____
Some ascetics and Brahmanists, living off food given in faith, maintain
themselves by such base arts and wrong means of livelihood such as these:

_Yathā vā paneke bhonto samaṇabrāhmaṇā saddhādeyyāni bhojanāni
bhuñjitvā te evarūpāya tiracchānavijjāya micchājīvena jīvikaṃ
kappenti seyyathīdaṃ_

(...) Determining lucky and unlucky gems, garments, staffs, swords, spears,
arrows, bows, sticks...

_maṇilakkhaṇaṃ vatthalakkhaṇaṃ daṇḍalakkhaṇaṃ
satthalakkhaṇaṃ asilakkhaṇaṃ usulakkhaṇaṃ dhanulakkhaṇaṃ
āvudhalakkhaṇaṃ_

(...) The ascetic Gotama refrains from these kinds of base arts and wrong means
of livelihood.

_iti evarūpāya tiracchānavijjāya micchājīvā paṭivirato samaṇo gotamo

Seven days after going forth [into the ascetic life] I attained the three final
knowledges

_sattāhaṃ pabbajitā tisso vijjā aphassayiṃ._
____

====
vijjā

final knowledge; vijjā, insightfulness into reality
====

[quote, Vin.3.3-4]
____
I directed my mind to the knowledge through recalling of past lives;

_pubbenivāsānussatiñāṇāya cittaṃ abhininnāmesiṃ._

(...) I recalled my manifold former lives with their aspects and particulars.
This was the first final knowledge attained by me in the first watch of the
night;

_Iti sākāraṃ sauddesaṃ anekavihitaṃ pubbenivāsaṃ anussarāmi. Ayaṃ
kho me brāhmaṇa rattiyā paṭhame yāme paṭhamā vijjā adhigatā_

Uninsightfulness into reality was dispelled, insightfulness into reality arose,
darkness was dispelled, light arose

_avijjā vihatā vijjā uppannā tamo vihato aloko uppanno_

I directed my mind towards the knowledge of the transmigration of beings

_sattānaṃ cutūpapātañāṇāya cittaṃ abhininnāmesiṃ._

(...) Thus with purified divine vision surpassing that of men, I saw beings
passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, well-favoured and
ill-favoured, fortunate and unfortunate, and discerned how beings fare
according to their deeds.

_Iti dibbena cakkhunā visuddhena atikkantamānusakena satte passāmi cavamāne
uppajjamāne hīne paṇīte suvaṇṇe dubbaṇṇe sugate duggate
yathākammūpage satte pajānāmi._

This was the second final knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of the
night.

_Ayaṃ kho me brāhmaṇa rattiyā majjhime yāme dutiyā vijjā adhigatā_

Uninsightfulness into reality was dispelled, insightfulness into reality arose,
darkness was dispelled, light arose

_avijjā vihatā vijjā uppannā tamo vihato āloko uppanno_

I directed my mind towards the knowledge of the destruction of perceptually
obscuring states.

_āsavānaṃ khayañāṇāya cittaṃ abhininnāmesiṃ._

(...) thus knowing, thus seeing, my mind was freed from the three perceptually
obscuring states.

_Tassa me evaṃ jānato evaṃ passato kāmāsavā pi cittaṃ vimuccittha.
Bhavāsavā pi cittaṃ vimuccittha. Avijjāsavā pi cittaṃ vimuccittha._

With release, there was the knowledge I was released. I knew that birth was
destroyed. The religious life has been fulfilled. What had to be done has been
done. There will be no further arising in any state of individual existence

_Vimuttasmiṃ vimuttami ti ñāṇaṃ ahosi. Khīṇā jāti vusitaṃ
brahmacariyaṃ kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ nāparaṃ itthattāyāti
abbhaññāsiṃ._

This was, brahman, the third final knowledge attained by me in the last watch
of the night.

_Ayaṃ kho me brāhmaṇa rattiyā pacchime yāme tatiyā vijjā adhigatā_

Uninsightfulness into reality was dispelled, insightfulness into reality arose,
darkness was dispelled, light arose.

_avijjā vihatā vijjā uppannā tamo vihato āloko uppanno._

existence, and has attained the destruction of birth, is a sage who has
achieved supernormal attainments.

_Pubbenivāsaṃ yo vedi saggāpāyañca passati +
Atho jātikkhayaṃ patto abhiññā vosito muni._

By these three final knowledges one is a Brahman master of threefold Vedic
knowledge.

_Etāhi tīhi vijjāhi tevijjo hoti brāhmaṇo_

He is the [true] master of threefold Vedic knowledge, I declare, not the one
who [merely] recites recitations

_Tamahaṃ vadāmi tevijjaṃ nāññaṃ lapitalāpanan ti._

[quote, D.1.248]
____
The brahman masters of threefold Vedic knowledge, when physically sitting they
are spiritually sinking, and in spiritually sinking they arrive at dejection,
all the while thinking they are crossing into some happier land.

_tevijjā brāhmaṇā āsīditvā saṃsīdanti saṃsīditvā visādaṃ vā
pāpuṇanti. Sukkhataraṇaṃ maññe pataranti._

Thus this threefold knowledge of such brahmans is called the threefold
knowledge of a waterless desert, the threefold knowledge of a pathless jungle,
the threefold knowledge of disasterous misfortune.

=== Daratha; Dara

==== Renderings

- _daratha_: suffering

- _dara_: suffering

==== Introduction

===== The perplexity of Daratha and Dara

_Daratha_ and _dara_ have proven perplexing. This is clear from their diverse
renderings:

1. PED:

- _Dara_: fear, terror; sorrow, pain

- _Daratha_: anxiety, care, distress

2. Bodhi:

- _Dara_: care (S.1.212); anguish (S.2.101); troublesome (A.2.11).

- _Daratha_: troubles (M.3.287); distress (M.3.136; M.1.77); disturbance
(M.3.108).

3. Norman:

- _Dara_: fear (Thī.v.32)

- _Daratha_: distress (Sn.v.15).

We will show in six contexts that both _dara_ and _daratha_ mean 'suffering.'

===== 1) Dara: suffering vs. inward peace

[quote, S.1.212]

Having eliminated suffering from the heart,

_vineyya hadaye daraṃ_

===== 4) Daratha: suffering with torment and anguish

[quote, M.3.287]
____
Craving that leads to renewed states of individual existence, accompanied by
spiritually fettering delight and attachment, taking delight in this and that,
grows. One's physical and psychological sufferings, torments, and anguishes
increase.

=== Dassana

==== Renderings

- _dassana_: vision

- _dassana_: vision [of things according to reality]

==== Introduction

===== Dassana with an object

_Dassana_ often has a specified object:

- _dassanañca rūpānaṃ_: vision of shapes (M.3.160).

- _bahiddhā parakāye ñāṇadassanaṃ_: knowledge and vision externally of
others' bodies [according to reality] (D.2.216).

- _maggāmaggañāṇadassana_: knowledge and vision of what is the Path and
what is not the Path (M.1.149-150).

===== Dassana without an object: 'things according to reality'

Where _dassana_ does not have an object, the suttas show that 'things according
to reality' should be taken as the object, which we now explain. Firstly,
compare these quotes, which shows that _Sammādassanaṃ_ equals
_yathābhūtañāṇadassana_. _Yathābhūta_ means 'things according to
reality' (see Glossary sv _Yathābhūta_):

1. Without knowledge and vision of things according to reality, for one lacking
in knowledge and vision of things according to reality, the condition for
disillusionment with and non-attachment [to originated phenomena] is cut off;
+
****
_Yathābhūtañāṇadassane asati yathābhūtañāṇadassanavipannassa
hatūpaniso hoti nibbidāvirāgo_ (A.3.19).
****

2. Right vision [of things according to reality], Rādha, is for the sake of
disillusionment [with originated phenomena].
+
****
_Sammādassanaṃ kho rādha nibbidatthaṃ_ (S.3.189).
****

===== Dassana without an object: 'transcendent insight'

In this passage, _dassana_ ('vision [of things according to reality]') is a
synonym of _abhiññāya_ (transcendent insight), which proves its supermundane
connotations:

[quote, M.1.320]
____
As the Blessed One explained the teaching to me with its increasingly higher
and more sublime levels, concerning what is inwardly dark and bright with their
correlative combinations, thus through transcendent insight (_abhiññāya_)
into a certain one of those teachings, I came to a conclusion about the
teachings. I gained faith in the Teacher thus:

_Yathā yathā me āvuso bhagavā dhammaṃ deseti uttaruttariṃ
paṇītapaṇītaṃ kaṇhasukkasappaṭibhāgaṃ tathā tathāhaṃ
tasmiṃ dhamme abhiññāya idhekaccaṃ dhammaṃ dhammesu
niṭṭhamagamaṃ satthari pasīdiṃ_

"The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened. The teaching is well explained by
the Blessed One. The community of disciples is applied to an excellent
practice.'

_sammā sambuddho bhagavā svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo supaṭipanno saṅgho
ti_

When one's faith in the [perfection of the] Perfect One's [transcendent
insight] is settled, rooted, and established, and described in these terms,
words, and phrases, then one's faith is said to be supported by reasons, rooted
in vision [of things according to reality] (_dassana_), and firm. It is not
shakeable by any ascetic, Brahmanist, deva, māra, or brahmā, or by anyone in
the world.

_Yassa kassa ci bhikkhave imehi ākārehi imehi padehi imehi vyañjanehi
tathāgate saddhā niviṭṭhā hoti mūlajātā patiṭṭhitā ayaṃ
vuccatī bhikkhave ākāravatī saddhā dassanamūlikā daḷhā asaṃhāriyā
samaṇena vā brāhmaṇena vā devena vā mārena vā brahmunā vā kenaci
vā lokasmiṃ._
____

===== Dhammadassana

In the term _dhammadassanaṃ_, we take _dhamma_ as 'things,' and parenthesise
('according to reality') accordingly:

[quote, Sn.v.204]
____
Therefore the wise person, remembering the Buddhas' training system, should
apply himself to faith [in the perfection of the Perfect One's transcendent
insight], to virtue, to serenity, and to vision of things [according to
reality].

_Tasmā saddhañca sīlañca pasādaṃ dhammadassanaṃ +
Anuyuñjetha medhāvī saraṃ buddhānaṃ sāsanan ti._

==== Introduction

===== Micchādiṭṭhi means wrong view [of reality]

The definition of _micchādiṭṭhi_ shows why it should be called 'wrong view
[of reality]':

[quote, M.3.71]
____
And what is wrong view [of reality]?

_Katamā ca bhikkhave micchādiṭṭhi?_

(...) [The view that] 'There is no merit in giving, donating and offering; no
fruit or result of good or bad deeds; no this world; no hereafter; no duties to
parents; no spontaneously arisen beings; no ascetics or Brahmanists who,
conducting and applying themselves rightly in the world, proclaim this world
and the hereafter after having realising it for themselves through transcendent
insight.

_Natthi dinnaṃ natthi yiṭṭhaṃ natthi hutaṃ natthi

samaṇabrāhmaṇā sammaggatā sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca lokaṃ parañca
lokaṃ sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī ti._
____

===== Sammādiṭṭhi: right view and right perception

_Sammādiṭṭhi_ is defined in two ways, so it has two meanings:

1. right view [of reality]

2. right perception [of reality]

Right view [of reality] is a primary practice, right perception [of reality] is
more advanced:

[quote, M.3.72]
____
What is right view/perception [of reality]?

_Katamā ca bhikkhave sammādiṭṭhi_

Right view/perception [of reality] is of two sorts, I declare.

_sammādiṭṭhimpahaṃ bhikkhave dvayaṃ vadāmi:_

There is (1) right view [of reality] associated with perceptually obscuring
states, that is meritorious and results in attachment, and (2) there is right
perception [of reality] that is noble, free of perceptually obscuring states,
transcendental, a factor of the Path.

_atthi bhikkhave sammādiṭṭhi sāsavā puññābhāgiyā upadhivepakkā
atthi bhikkhave sammādiṭṭhi ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā._

What is right view [of reality] associated with perceptually obscuring states,
that is meritorious and results in attachment?

_Katamā ca bhikkhave sammādiṭṭhi sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā_

There is merit in giving, donating and offering; there is a fruit and result of
good and bad deeds; there exists both this world and a world beyond; there are
duties to parents; there are spontaneously arisen beings; there are ascetics
and Brahmanists conducting and applying themselves rightly in the world who,
having realised this world and the world hereafter for themselves through
transcendent insight, make them known to others.

_atthi dinnaṃ atthi yiṭṭhaṃ atthi hutaṃ atthi sukaṭadukkaṭānaṃ
kammānaṃ phalaṃ vipāko atthi ayaṃ loko atthi paro loko atthi mātā
atthi pitā atthi sattā opapātikā atthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā
sammaggatā sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca lokaṃ parañca lokaṃ sayaṃ
abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentīti_

And what is right perception [of reality] that is noble, free of perceptually
obscuring states, transcendental, a factor of the Path?

_Katamā ca bhikkhave sammādiṭṭhi ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā:_

The penetrative discernment, the faculty of penetrative discernment, the power
of penetrative discernment, the enlightenment factor of examination of the
teaching, the right perception [of reality] in one whose mind is noble, whose
mind is free of perceptually obscuring states, who is developing the noble
path, is right perception [of reality] that is noble, free of perceptually
obscuring states, transcendental, a factor of the Path.

_Yā kho bhikkhave ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino
ariyamaggaṃ bhāvayato paññā paññindriyaṃ paññābalaṃ
dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgo sammādiṭṭhi maggaṅgaṃ ayaṃ vuccati
bhikkhave sammādiṭṭhi ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā._
____

===== Sammādiṭṭhi means perception: four reasons

There are four definitions that support us rendering the higher meaning of
_sammādiṭṭhi_ in terms of perception, not view:

The scriptures define _sammādiṭṭhi_ in terms of discernment (_pajānāti_):

[quote, M.1.46-7]
____
When a noble disciple discerns suffering... On these grounds a noble disciple
has right perception [of reality]

_Yato kho āvuso ariyasāvako dukkhañca pajānāti... ettāvatā pi kho āvuso
ariyasāvako sammādiṭṭhi hoti._

When a noble disciple discerns what is spiritually unwholesome... On these
grounds a noble disciple has right perception [of reality].

_Yato kho āvuso ariyasāvako akusalañca pajānāti... Ettāvatā pi kho
āvuso ariyasāvako sammādiṭṭhi hoti._
____

[quote, M.3.72]
____
He knows wrong view [of reality] as wrong view [of reality] and right
perception [of reality] as right perception [of reality]. That is his right
perception [of reality].

_Micchādiṭṭhiṃ micchādiṭṭhī ti pajānāti sammādiṭṭhiṃ
sammādiṭṭhī ti pajānāti sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi._
____

The scriptures define _sammādiṭṭhi_ in terms of insightfulness (_vijjāgata_):

[quote, S.5.1]
____
For an intelligent person with insight into reality, right perception [of
reality] arises.

_vijjāgatassa bhikkhave viddasuno sammādiṭṭhi pahoti._
____

The scriptures define _sammādiṭṭhi_ in terms of perceiving (_passati_):

[quote, S.3.51]
____
A bhikkhu perceives as unlasting, bodily form which is indeed unlasting. That
is his right perception [of reality].

_Aniccaññeva bhikkhave bhikkhu rūpaṃ aniccanti passati sāssa hoti
sammādiṭṭhi._
____

The scriptures define _sammādiṭṭhi_ in terms of knowledge [of things according to reality] (_ñāṇaṃ_):

[quote, M.3.251]
____
Whatsoever is the knowledge of suffering [according to reality], of the origin
of suffering, the ending of suffering, and of the practice leading to the
ending of suffering, is called right perception [of reality].

_yaṃ kho āvuso dukkhe ñāṇaṃ dukkhasamudaye ñāṇaṃ dukkhanirodhe
ñāṇaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminiyā paṭipadāya ñāṇaṃ. Ayaṃ
vuccatāvuso sammādiṭṭhi._
____

===== Diṭṭhi: view and dogmatic view

_Diṭṭhi_ sometimes means simply 'view.' But where a view is formally
propounded we call it 'dogmatic view'. A dogmatic view is associated with the
idea 'This alone is true.' For example, Sn.v.895 asks:

[quote, Sn.v.895]
____
For those who dispute, maintaining a dogmatic view, saying "This alone is
true," is criticism all that they bring upon themselves? Do they not also
receive praise?

_Ye kecime diṭṭhiṃ paribbasānā idameva saccan ti vivādayanti +
Sabbeva te nindamanvānayanti atho pasaṃsampi labhanti tattha._
____

[quote, M.2.171]
____
The wise do not resort to any dogmatic view because it may turn out to be
either true or false. Under such conditions, 'it is not fitting for a wise man
who preserves truth to come to the unqualified conclusion, "This alone is true,

==== Introduction

===== Dukkha of tilakkhaṇa: 'existentially void'

_Dukkha_ occurs in relation to _anicca_ in the question: '_Yaṃ panāniccaṃ
dukkhaṃ vā taṃ sukhaṃ vā ti?.'_ The constant answer to this is that
whatever is _anicca_ is _dukkha_. Here we render _dukkha_ as 'existentially
void,' by which we mean 'void of lasting substance.' And because we render
_dukkha_ as 'existentially void' ('that which is unlasting is existentially
void') we correspondingly render _sukhaṃ_ as 'existentially substantial':

[quote, M.1.232]
____
That which is unlasting, is it existentially void or existentially substantial?

_Yaṃ panāniccaṃ dukkhaṃ vā taṃ sukhaṃ vā ti._
____

Rendering _dukkha_ as 'existentially void' is supported on etymological
grounds. This is how the _Visuddhimagga_ sees it:

[quote, Vism.494 tr. Ñāṇamoli]
____
The word _du_ ("bad") is met with in the sense of vile (_kucchita_); for they
call a vile child a _du-putta_ ("bad child"). The word _kham_ ("-ness"),
however is met with in the sense of empty (_tuccha_), for they call empty space
"_kham_." And the first truth is vile because it is the haunt of many dangers,
and it is empty because it is devoid of the lastingness, beauty, pleasure, and
self, as conceived by rash people. So it is called _dukkhaṃ_ ("badness"=
suffering, pain), because of vileness and emptiness.

_du-iti ayaṃ saddo kucchite dissati. Kucchitaṃ hi puttaṃ dupputtoti
vadanti. Khaṃ-saddo pana tucche. Tucchaṃ hi ākāsaṃ khan ti vuccati.
Idañca paṭhamasaccaṃ kucchitaṃ anekaupaddavādhiṭṭhānato. Tucchaṃ
bālajanaparikappitadhuvasubhasukhattabhāvavirahitato. Tasmā kucchitattā
tucchattā ca dukkhanti vuccati._
____

The Sanskrit-English Dictionary (Monier-Williams) raises the possibility of
double roots. It says that although _duḥkhā_ is often considered to be
_dus+kha_, it is more probably a Prākritised form for _duḥ+stha_. Likewise,
_sukhā_ is said to be _su+kha_, but is possibly a Prākrit form of _su+stha_.
And whereas _khā_ means 'vacuity, empty space, air, ether, sky,' _stha_ means
'standing, staying, abiding, being situated in, existing or being in, or on, or
among.'

Our own studies suggest that _sukha_ and _dukkha_ stem from both roots. Thus
the underlying sense of _sukha_ and _dukkha_ is twofold:

1. 'Standing well' and 'standing badly' support the connotations of pleasure
and pain.

2. 'Vacuity' supports the connotation of existential voidness.

This leads us to rendering the _dukkha_ of the three characteristics
(_tilakkhaṇa_) as 'existentially void' and _sukha_ as 'existentially
substantial.' Modern scholars accept the possibility of this. For example
Rāhula says:

- 'The term _dukkha_ in the First Noble Truth contains, quite obviously, the
ordinary meaning of 'suffering,' but in addition it also includes deeper ideas
such as 'imperfection,' 'impermanence,' 'emptiness,' 'insubstantiality' (What
the Buddha Taught, p.17).

===== Dukkha of tilakkhaṇa: 'unsatisfactory'

Other scholars prefer 'unsatisfactory.' Kalupahana says:

- 'The word dukkha is rendered variously as 'ill,' 'suffering,' 'pain,' and so
on, which may be correct in certain contexts. But in other contexts, for
example, where it is said that the five aggregates of grasping
(_pañcupādānakkhandha_) are _dukkha_, the term is used in the wider sense of
'unsatisfactory' (Buddhist Philosophy: A Historical Analysis, p.45).

But 'unsatisfactory' does not fit well here. The three characteristics of
existence (_tilakkhaṇa_) are intrinsic to existence. These characteristics
can therefore be contemplated continuously, without a break, uninterruptedly.
For example, unlastingness (_anicca_), or the voidness of personal qualities
(_anatta_):

[quote, A.4.146]
____
In this regard, some person in relation to the visual sense abides
contemplating unlastingness, perceiving unlastingness, experiencing
unlastingness continuously, without a break, uninterruptedly, intent upon it
mentally, penetrating it with penetrative discernment

_idha bhikkhave ekacco puggalo cakkhusmiṃ aniccānupassī viharati
aniccasaññī aniccapaṭisaṃvedī satataṃ samitaṃ abbokiṇṇaṃ
cetasā adhimuccamāno paññāya pariyogāhamāno._
____

[quote, A.4.146]
____
In this regard, some person in relation to the visual sense abides
contemplating the voidness of personal qualities, perceiving the voidness of
personal qualities, experiencing the voidness of personal qualities
continuously, without a break, uninterruptedly, intent upon it mentally,
penetrating it with penetrative discernment

_idha bhikkhave ekacco puggalo cakkhusmiṃ anattānupassī viharati
anattasaññī anattapaṭisaṃvedī satataṃ samitaṃ abbokiṇṇaṃ
cetasā adhimuccamāno paññāya pariyogāhamāno._
____

If _dukkha_ meant unsatisfactory the instruction would read:

[quote, A.4.146]
____
In this regard, some person in relation to the visual sense abides
contemplating unsatisfactoriness, perceiving unsatisfactoriness, experiencing
unsatisfactoriness continuously, without a break, uninterruptedly, intent upon
it mentally, penetrating it with penetrative discernment

_idha bhikkhave ekacco puggalo cakkhusmiṃ dukkhānupassī viharati
dukkhasaññī dukkhapaṭisaṃvedī satataṃ samitaṃ abbokiṇṇaṃ
cetasā adhimuccamāno paññāya pariyogāhamāno._
____

But the reflection that things are unsatisfactory involves a relationship with
an observer. If things are unsatisfactory it is because they do not satisfy an
observer. Unsatisfactoriness is not an intrinsic quality of things. It is not
something to be continuously observed, whereas existential voidness is:

[quote, A.4.146]
____

contemplating existential voidness, perceiving existential voidness,
experiencing existential voidness continuously, without a break,
uninterruptedly, intent upon it mentally, penetrating it with penetrative

===== Existential voidness and other aspects of the teachings

The term 'existentially void' is in accordance with other aspects of the
teachings:

[quote, Sn.v.1070]
____
Being intent upon the perception of nonexistence, being mindful, with the help
of the reflection 'It does not exist,' cross the flood [of suffering].

_Ākiñcaññaṃ pekkhamāno satimā natthī ti nissāya tarassu oghaṃ._
____

The five reflections of the _Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta_. For example:

[quote, S.3.140-1]
____
Bhikkhus, suppose that this river Ganges was carrying along a large lump of
froth. A clear-sighted man would examine it, ponder it, and properly
investigate it. As he does so, it would appear to be empty, hollow,
insubstantial. For what substantial reality could there be in a lump of froth?

So, too, whatever kind of bodily form there is, whether past, future, or
present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or sublime, far or
near: a bhikkhu examines it, ponders it, and properly investigates it. As he
does so, it would appear to be empty, hollow, insubstantial. For what
substantial reality could there be in bodily form?

_Seyyathā pi bhikkhave ayaṃ gaṅgānadī mahantaṃ pheṇapiṇḍaṃ

explanation of this well-known quote:

[quote, "Bodhi, S.3.119"]
____
Formerly, Anuradha, and also now, I make known just suffering and the cessation
of suffering.

_pubbe cāhaṃ anurādha etarahi ca dukkhañceva paññāpemi dukkhassa ca
nirodhanti._
____

In the note to this, Bodhi explains _dukkha_ as meaning 'containing no
permanent essence':

- 'This oft-quoted dictum can be interpreted at two levels. At the more
superficial level the Buddha can be read as saying that he does not make any
declaration about such metaphysical questions as an afterlife but teaches only
a practical path for reaching the end of suffering here and now. This
interpretation, however, does not connect the dictum with the Buddha's previous
statement that the Tathāgata is not apprehended in this very lifetime. To make
this connection we have to bring in the second interpretation, according to
which the "Tathāgata" is a mere term of conventional usage referring to a
compound of impermanent formations, which are "suffering" because they contain
no permanent essence. It is just these that stand while the Tathāgata lives,
and just these that cease with his passing away.' (CDB p.1080 n.165).

This justifies our translating as follows:

[quote, "Varado, S.3.119"]
____
Formerly and also now, I explain just existential voidness and the ending of
existential voidness.

_pubbe cāhaṃ anurādha etarahi ca dukkhañceva paññāpemi dukkhassa ca
nirodhanti._
____

A similar quote occurs in the _Alagaddūpama Sutta_ where the Buddha, responds
to the accusation that he teaches the annihilation, destruction, and cessation
of a living being (_sattassa ucchedaṃ vināsaṃ vibhavaṃ paññāpetī
ti_). He replied in the same words: _Pubbe cāhaṃ bhikkhave etarahi ca
dukkhañceva paññāpemi dukkhassa ca nirodhaṃ_ (M.1.140).

This reply again supports us rendering _dukkha_ as 'existential voidness', not
'suffering.'

===== Dukkha in the summary of the teaching: the dukkha of tilakkhaṇa

As we have said, _dukkha_ occurs in the Buddha's summary of his teaching: 'I
explain just _dukkha_ and the ending of _dukkha_ (_dukkhañceva paññāpemi
dukkhassa ca nirodhanti_ S.3.119). The scriptures show that this _dukkha_ is
related to _anicca_, and is therefore the dukkha of _tilakkhaṇa,_ meaning
'existential voidness.' Two suttas prove this point.

1. Firstly, when the Buddha said 'Whatever is experienced is included within
_dukkha_ (_yaṃ kiñci vedayitaṃ taṃ dukkhasmin ti_) he explained that
'This has been stated by me with reference to the unlastingness of originated
phenomena' (_taṃ kho panetaṃ bhikkhu mayā saṅkhārānaññeva
aniccataṃ sandhāya bhāsitaṃ_ S.4.216).

2. Secondly, when the Buddha asked Sāriputta to explain how spiritually
fettering delight in sense impression no longer remained present in him (_yā
vedanāsu nandī sā na upaṭṭhāsī ti_), Sāriputta answered:

____
-- There are these three types of sense impression. What three? Pleasant sense
impression, unpleasant sense impression, and neutral sense impression.

_tisso kho imā āvuso vedanā katamā tisso? Sukhā vedanā dukkhā vedanā
adukkhamasukhā vedanā_

(...) These three types of sense impression are unlasting. Whatever is unlasting
is existentially void. When this was understood, spiritually fettering delight
in sense impression no longer remained present in me.' Being asked thus,
bhante, I would answer in such a way."

_imā kho āvuso tisso vedanā aniccā. Yadaniccaṃ taṃ dukkhan ti
viditaṃ. Yā vedanāsu nandī sā na upaṭṭhāsī ti. Evaṃ
puṭṭhohaṃ bhante evaṃ vyākareyyanti._
____

The Buddha responded:

[quote, S.2.53]
____
-- Very good, Sāriputta! This is another method of explaining in brief that
same point: 'Whatever is experienced is included within _dukkha_.'

_yaṃ kiñci vedayitaṃ taṃ dukkhasmin ti._
____

Thus when _dukkha_ is applied comprehensively to all things it is linked to
_anicca_, and is therefore the dukkha of _tilakkhaṇa,_ meaning 'existential
voidness.'

===== Dukkha in the four noble truths: suffering

The _dukkha_ of the four noble truths is 'suffering':

[quote, S.5.422]
____
Birth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering;

_jāti pi dukkhā jarāpi dukkhā maraṇampi dukkhaṃ_

grief, lamentation, physical pain, psychological pain, and vexation are
suffering;

_sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsāpi dukkhā_

association with the unbeloved is suffering; separation from the beloved is
suffering;

_appiyehi sampayogo dukkho piyehi vippayogo dukkho_

not getting what one wants, that too is suffering.

_yampicchaṃ na labhati tampi dukkhaṃ_

In brief the five grasped aggregates are suffering.

_saṅkhittena pañcupādānakkhandhā dukkhā._
____

[quote, S.5.430]
____
'This is suffering': an effort should be made [to profoundly understand this].

_Idaṃ dukkhan ti yogo karaṇīyo._

'This is the origin of suffering': an effort should be made [to abandon this].

_Ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo ti yogo karaṇīyo._

'This is the ending of suffering': an effort should be made [to realise this].

_Ayaṃ dukkhanirodho ti yogo karaṇīyo._

'This is the practice leading to the ending of suffering': an effort should be
made [to develop this].

_Ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ti yogo karaṇīyo._
____

===== Suffering: the actual and the psychological

Suffering has two connotations, which we will call 1) 'the actual' and 2) 'the
psychologically based'. For example, the body itself is sometimes called
suffering, but sometimes suffering is said to arise from attachment to the
body. Some quotes contain a mixture of both connotations.

The actual:

[quote, S.3.32]
____
Bhikkhus, the arising, establishment, rebirth and appearance of bodily form is
the arising of suffering.

_Yo rūpassa uppādo ṭhīti abhinibbatti pātubhāvo dukkhasseso uppādo._
____

The psychologically based:

[quote, Ud.32-3]
____
Suffering arises because of attachment. With the destruction of all grasping
there is no arising of suffering.

_upadhiṃ paṭicca dukkhamidaṃ sambhoti sabbūpādānakkhayā natthi
dukkhassa sambhavo._
____

[quote, M.1.191]
____
Whatever within these five grasped aggregates is the elimination and rejection
of fondness and attachment is the ending of suffering.

_Yo imesu pañcasupādānakkhandhesu chandarāgavinayo chandarāgappahānaṃ
so dukkhanirodho ti._
____

Both actual and psychologically based:

[quote, Th.v.1116]
____
Properly regard the [five grasped] aggregates as suffering, and abandon that
from which suffering arises.

_Dukkhan ti khandhe paṭipassa yoniso yato ca dukkhaṃ samudeti taṃ jaha._
____

===== Dukkha in other contexts

We render _dukkha_ in other contexts as follows:

1. _Dukkha_ as a sense impression: 'pain' (noun) or 'unpleasant' (adjective).
'Painful' is unuseable as the general adjective because 'pain' applies only to
bodily felt sensation. 'Unpleasant' covers all sensations like sounds, smells
etc.

2. _Dukkha_ in opposition to psychological pain (e.g. _dukkhehi domanassehi_):
'physical pain.'

3. _Dukkhindriyaṃ_ is called 'the faculty of physical pain,' being in
contrast to _domanassindriyaṃ_ 'the faculty of psychological pain,' S.5.211).

Sometimes 'miserable' is an appropriate adjective:

[quote, D.1.31]
____
They declare that the [absolute] Selfhood after death is altogether happy, not
subject to decay, and conscious. They declare that the [absolute] Selfhood
after death is altogether miserable, not subject to decay, and conscious.

=== Domanassa

==== Renderings

- _domanassa_: psychological pain

- _domanassa_: dejection

==== Introduction

===== Fathoming domanassa

The puzzling nature of _domanassa_ is apparent in Bodhi's renderings:

- grief, MLDB (1995)

- displeasure, CDB (2000)

- dejection, NDB (2012)

===== Domanassa in the five faculties of sense impression

One meaning of _domanassa_ is found in the five faculties of sense impression,
which concern the pleasantness and unpleasantness of sense impression and
moods, where we call _domanassa_ 'psychological pain.' The five faculties of
sense impression are:

[quote, S.5.211]
____
the faculty of physical pleasure

_sukhindriyaṃ_

the faculty of physical pain

_dukkhindriyaṃ_

the faculty of psychological pleasure

_somanassindriyaṃ_

the faculty of psychological pain

_domanassindriyaṃ_

the faculty of physical-plus-psychological neutral experience, namely, whatever
sense impression, either physical or psychological, that is neither pleasing
nor displeasing

_upekkhindriyaṃ yaṃ kho bhikkhave kāyikaṃ vā cetasikaṃ vā neva
sātaṃ nāsātaṃ vedayitaṃ._
____

Psychological pain apparently stems from thought, because it ceases in second
jhāna, when thought ceases (_vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā_, S.5.214).
Psychological pleasure (_somanassa_) is obviously unrelated to thought, because
it is not abandoned till fourth jhāna (S.5.215).

===== Dukkhadomanassa: psychological pain

A common pairing for _domanassa_ is with _dukkha_ in the phrase
_dukkhadomanassa_ which means 'physical and psychological pain.' It may seem
curious that attachment would cause not only psychological but also physical
pain:

- Some person is by nature full of attachment (_pakatiyāpi tibbarāgajātiko
hoti_); he experiences the physical and psychological pain that are born of
attachment (_rāgajaṃ dukkhaṃ domanassaṃ paṭisaṃvedeti_) (A.2.149).

But this is well documented in the scriptures, particularly with reference to
_taṇhā_:

[quote, M.3.287]
____
Craving that leads to renewed states of individual existence, accompanied by
spiritually fettering delight and attachment, taking delight in this and that,
grows.

_Taṇhā cassa ponobhavikā nandirāgasahagatā tatra tatrābhinandinī sā
cassa pavaḍḍhati._

(...) One's physical and psychological sufferings, torments, and anguishes
increase.

_tassa kāyikāpi darathā pavaḍḍhanti cetasikāpi darathā pavaḍḍhanti
kayikāpi santāpā pavaḍḍhanti cetasikāpi santāpā pavaḍḍhanti
kāyikāpi pariḷāhā pavaḍḍhanti cetasikāpi pariḷāhā
pavaḍḍhanti_

(...) One experiences physical and psychological unpleasantness

_so kāyadukkhampi cetodukkhampi paṭisaṃvedeti._
____

===== Dejection

_Domanassa_, as a mood, means dejection. It occurs for example in the phrase
_abhijjhādomanassā_ greed and dejection. Dejection means 'lowness of spirits
or downheartedness.'

[quote, S.5.213-4]

And where does the arisen faculty of psychological pain cease without
remainder? With the subsiding of thinking and pondering, and [the development
of] internal serenity and concentration, being without thinking and pondering,
and being filled with rapture and physical pleasure born of inward
collectedness, a bhikkhu enters and abides in second jhāna. And it is here
that the arisen faculty of psychological pain ceases without remainder.

____
The end of a waistband

_Kāyabandhanassa anto._
____

[quote, Thī.v.447]

____

===== Fathoming the special meanings

The meaning of _dve anta_ cannot be fathomed from the ordinary meaning of
_anta_, and likewise the special meanings of _majjhe_ and _majjhima_ cannot be
fathomed from their ordinary meanings. Failing to appreciate this has led to
the neologisms, 'the two extremes' (_dve antā_) and 'the Middle Way'
(_majjhimā paṭipadā_).

===== Anta: doctrinal principle

_Anta_ can mean 'doctrinal principle', which the dictionaries call 'opposing
principle' (DOP), and 'constituent principle' (PED).

____
Three doctrinal principles

_Tayo antā_
____

1. personal identity as a doctrinal principle

+
****
_sakkāyasamudayo anto_
****

3. the ending of personal identity as a doctrinal principle
+
****
_sakkāyanirodho anto_ (D.3.216).
****

===== Anta and majjhimā paṭipadā: Rāsiya Sutta

That _anta_ and _majjhimā paṭipadā_ mean unenlightening practice and
enlightening practice is demonstrated in the _Rāsiya Sutta_ (S.4.331) which
says:

[quote, "Vin.1.10, S.4.331"]
____
There are these two unenlightening practices which should not be undertaken by
one who has gone forth [into the ascetic life]:

_Dve'me bhikkhave antā pabbajitena na sevitabbā:_

The pursuit of sensuous pleasures, which is low, vulgar, the way of the common
man, ignoble, and unconducive to spiritual well-being

_yo cāyaṃ kāmesu kāmasukhallikānuyogo hīno gammo pothujjaniko anariyo
anatthasaṃhito_

The pursuit of self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and unconducive
to spiritual well-being

_yo cāyaṃ attakilamathānuyogo dukkho anariyo anatthasaṃhito._

Not veering towards these two unenlightening practices, the Perfect One has
awakened to an enlightening practice, which gives rise to vision, which gives
rise to knowledge, which leads to inward peace, to transcendent insight, to
enlightenment, and to the Untroubled.

_Ete te bhikkhave ubho ante anupagamma majjhimā paṭipadā tathāgatena
abhisambuddhā cakkhukaraṇī ñāṇakaraṇi upasamāya abhiññāya
sambodhāya nibbānaya saṃvattati._

And what is that enlightening practice awakened to by the Perfect One, which
gives rise to vision... leads to the Untroubled?

_Katamā ca sā gāmaṇi majjhimā paṭipadā tathāgatena abhisambuddhā
cakkhukaraṇī ñāṇakaraṇī upasamāya abhiññāya sambodhāya
nibbānāya saṃvattati_

It is this noble eightfold path, namely: right perception [of reality]... right
inward collectedness

_Ayameva ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo seyyathīdaṃ sammādiṭṭhi
sammāsaṅkappo sammāvācā sammākammanto sammāājivo sammāvāyāmo
sammāsati sammāsamādhi._
____

Here:

1. _dve ante_ are unconducive to spiritual well-being (_anatthasaṃhito_).

2. _majjhimā paṭipadā_ 'gives rise to vision, which gives rise to
knowledge, which leads to inward peace, to transcendent insight, to
enlightenment, and to the Untroubled.'

Therefore _ubho ante_ means 'two unenlightening practices,' and _majjhimā
paṭipadā_ means 'enlightening practice.'

===== Anta and majjhimā paṭipadā: Araṇavibhaṅga Sutta

That _anta_ and _majjhimā paṭipadā_ mean unenlightening practice and
enlightening practice is demonstrated in the _Araṇavibhaṅga Sutta_ which
says:

- The pursuit of the pleasure and happiness that is linked to sensuous pleasure
is wrong practice (_micchāpaṭipadā_).

- Disengagement from the pursuit of such pleasure and happiness is right
practice (_sammāpaṭipadā_).

- The pursuit of self-mortification is wrong practice (_micchāpaṭipadā_).

- Disengagement from the pursuit of self-mortification is right practice
(_sammāpaṭipadā_).

[quote, M.3.230-1]
____
Not veering towards these two unenlightening practices, the Perfect One has
awakened to an enlightening practice, which gives rise to vision, which gives
rise to knowledge, which leads to inward peace, to transcendent insight, to
enlightenment, and to the Untroubled.

_Ete te ubho ante anupagamma majjhimā paṭipadā tathāgatena abhisambuddhā
cakkhukaraṇī ñāṇakaraṇi upasamāya abhiññāya sambodhāya nibbānaya
saṃvattati.._
____

Here:

1. _ubho ante_ means the two forms of _micchāpaṭipadā_

2. _majjhimā paṭipadā_ corresponds to the two forms of _sammāpaṭipadā_,
and is a practice 'which gives rise to vision, which gives rise to knowledge,
which leads to inward peace, to transcendent insight, to enlightenment, and to
the Untroubled.'

Therefore _ubho ante_ can again be called 'two unenlightening practices,' and
_majjhimā paṭipadā_ 'enlightening practice.'

===== Sassatadiṭṭhi and ucchedadiṭṭhi

The eternalist view (_sassatadiṭṭhi_, S.3.99) is the view that 'I am or
will be everlasting' (_bhavissāmi nicco_). The annihilationist view
(_ucchedadiṭṭhi_) is the view 'I will be not' (_na bhavissāmi_, S.3.99).
These views are sometimes called _sassataṃ_ and _ucchedaṃ_, as if
_diṭṭhi_ was redundant, for example in this quote:

[quote, S.2.19-20]
____
Such a belief amounts to eternalism.

_iti vadaṃ sassataṃ etaṃ pareti_

Such a belief amounts to annihilationism

_iti vadaṃ ucchedaṃ etaṃ pareti._
____

===== Sassataṃ and ucchedaṃ: 'two ante'

In the _Acelakassapa Sutta sassataṃ_ and _ucchedaṃ_ are called 'two _ante'_:

[quote, S.2.19-20]
____
Not veering towards these two _ante_, the Perfect One explains a teaching via
_majjhena_.

_Ete te kassapa ubho ante anupagamma majjhena tathāgato dhammaṃ deseti_

(Namely, the doctrine of dependent origination, _paṭiccasamuppāda_)_

_Avijjāpaccayā saṅkhārā..._

Such is the ending of this whole mass of suffering._

_Evametassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa nirodho hotī ti._
____

Thus _ubho ante_ is an abbreviation for _sassatadiṭṭhi_ and
_ucchedadiṭṭhi_, which we call 'unenlightening doctrines.'

_Majjhena_ is the counterpart of _anta_. It leads to 'the ending of this whole
mass of suffering.' We call it 'enlightening doctrine.'

===== Ubho ante: origin and destiny

The _Salla Sutta_ says:

[quote, Sn.v.582]
____
He whose path you do not know, whether arriving or departing, knowing neither
his origin nor destiny, you lament for him uselessly.

_Yassa maggaṃ na jānāsi āgatassa gatassa vā +
Ubho ante asampassaṃ niratthaṃ paridevasi._
____

We render _ubho ante_ here according to the context, by which it is linked to
_maggaṃ... āgatassa gatassa_. The commentary likewise says: _Yassa
mātukucchiṃ āgatassa āgatamaggaṃ vā ito cavitvā aññattha gatassa
gatamaggaṃ vā na jānāsi, tassa ime ubho ante asampassaṃ niratthaṃ
paridevasi._

===== Ubho ante: in either world

This verse links _ubho ante_ to _idha vā huraṃ vā_:

[quote, Sn.v.801]
____
One with no aspiration for any state of individual existence in either world,
this world or the world beyond, has no attachment to dogmatic religious views.

_Yassūbhayante paṇidhīdha natthi bhavābhavāya idha vā huraṃ vā +
Nivesanā tassa na santi keci dhammesu niccheyya samuggahītaṃ._
____

This allows us to parenthesise accordingly:

[quote, Sn.v.778]
____
You should eliminate desire for both worlds, [this world and the world beyond].

_Ubhosu antesu vineyya chandaṃ._
____

This parenthesis hopefully solves a puzzle with a long history: see Norman's
note on this verse.

The origin of personal identity as a doctrinal principle

_sakkāyasamudayanto _

The ending of personal identity as a doctrinal principle

[quote, M.3.230-1]
____
The pursuit of the pleasure and happiness that is linked to sensuous pleasure
is low, vulgar, the way of the common man, ignoble, and unconducive to
spiritual well-being. It is a state associated with pain, distress, vexation,
and anguish. It is wrong practice.

_yo kāmapaṭisandhisukhino somanassānuyogo hīno gammo pothujjaniko anariyo

Disengagement from the pursuit of such pleasure and happiness is a state not
associated with pain, distress, vexation, and anguish. It is a right practice.

Disengagement from the pursuit of self-mortification, which is painful,

==== Introduction

===== Fluctuation of meaning

The fluctuation in the meaning of _dhamma_ makes for difficult translating.
Consider, for example, Dh.v.259, where _dhamma_ has three meanings:

1. the teaching

2. the nature of reality

3. the practice

[quote, Dh.v.259]
____
One is not expert in the teaching (_dhamma_) through being loquacious. He who,
after hearing just a little, realises the nature of reality (_dhammaṃ_) with
his very being, and is not negligent of the practice (_dhammaṃ_), is truly
expert in the teaching (_dhamma_).

_Na tāvatā dhammadharo yāvatā bahu bhāsati; Yo ca appampi sutvāna
dhammaṃ kāyena passati sa ve dhammadharo hoti yo dhammaṃ nappamajjati._
____

===== 'The practice'

'The practice' means 'the practice of the teaching':

[quote, S.1.169]
____
The practice is a lake with fords of virtue, unmuddied, praised by good people
to good people, where those who are blessed with profound knowledge go to
bathe, and, dry-limbed, cross to the Far Shore.

_Dhammo rahadobrāhmaṇa sīlatittho anāvilo sabbhi sataṃ pasattho +
Yattha have vedaguno sinātā anallagattā va taranti pāraṃ._
____

===== Dhammaṭṭho: 'established in righteousness'

_Dhammaṭṭho_ is associated with arahantship. In the commentary to the
following quote, it is analysed as _dhamme ṭhito_:

[quote, Thī.v.740]
____
He is possessed of the supreme goal, he is established in righteousness.

_So atthavā so dhammaṭṭho._
____

In the following quote it is analysed as _asekkhadhammesu nibbānadhamme eva
vā ṭhito_:

[quote, It.53]
____
The one who is blessed with profound knowledge, being established in
righteousness, though he makes use of conception he is beyond the limits of
conception.

_Saṅkhāya sevī dhammaṭṭho saṅkhaṃ nopeti vedagū ti._
____

===== Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta: singular not plural

The _Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta_ says:

[quote, S.5.183]
____
A bhikkhu abides contemplating [co-conditional] origination in relation to the
body... [co-conditional] disappearance in relation to the body...
[co-conditional] origination and disappearance in relation to the body.

_bhikkhu samudayadhammānupassī kāyasmiṃ viharati... vayadhammānupassī
kāyasmiṃ viharati... samudayavayadhammānupassī kāyasmiṃ viharati._
____

If _dhamma_ in _samudayadhammānupassī kāyasmiṃ_ is regarded as a plural
then 'origination factors of the body' would be meant, and one would have
expected a genitive case here, not a locative. The genitive occurs in such
phrases as:

____
the maintenance and nourishment of this [wretched human] body

_imassa kāyassa ṭhitiyā yāpanāya_

the demise of the body

_kāyassa bhedā_
____

Therefore we treat the word as a singular. That we also treat it as redundant,
we will explain below.

===== Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta: the problem of pluralising

If '[co-conditional] origination' is converted into 'origination factors' it
has the following effect: instead of contemplating the phenomena of origination
and disappearance in relation to phenomena, one instead focuses on the various
factors that give rise to phenomena. This has two drawbacks:

1. One remains enmeshed in the conception of 'things.'

2. This practice would not be possible when mindfulness is practised without
thinking:

[quote, A.4.301]
____
When you have thus developed and cultivated this meditation, then bhikkhu you
should develop this meditation accompanied by thinking and pondering; without
thinking, just pondering; without thinking or pondering.

_Yato kho te bhikkhu ayaṃ samādhi evaṃ bhāvito hoti bahulīkato tato
tvaṃ bhikkhū imaṃ samādhiṃ savitakkampi savicāraṃ bhāveyyāsi.
Avitakkampi vicāramattaṃ bhāveyyāsi. Avitakkampi avicāraṃ bhāveyyāsi._
____

===== Kālāma Sutta: teachings

In the _Kālāma Sutta dhammā_ means 'teachings,' and is equivalent to
_vādaṃ_ in the following passage, which we have divided into Question and
Answer:

*Question:*

____
-- There are some ascetics and Brahmanists, bhante, who visit Kesaputta. They
expound and explain only their own teachings (_vādaṃ_); the teachings
(_vādaṃ_) of others they despise, revile, and pull to pieces. Some other
ascetics and Brahmanists too, bhante, come to Kesaputta. They also expound and
explain only their own teachings; the teachings of others they despise, revile,
and pull to pieces."

_Te sakaṃyeva vādaṃ dīpenti jotenti parappavādaṃ pana khuṃsenti
vambhenti paribhavanti omakkhiṃ karonti_

(...) Bhante, there is unsureness, there is doubt in us concerning them. Which of
these reverend ascetics and Brahmanists spoke the truth and which falsehood?"

_Tesaṃ no bhante amhākaṃ hoteva kaṅkhā hoti vicikicchā. Ko su nāma
imesaṃ bhavataṃ samaṇabrāhmaṇānaṃ saccaṃ āha ko musā ti?_
____

*Answer:*

[quote, A.1.189]
____
-- Kālāmas, if you yourselves should consider:

_Yadā tumhe kālāmā attanāva jāneyyātha_

(...) These teachings (_dhammā_) are unwholesome;

_ime dhammā akusalā_

(...) these teachings (_dhammā_) are unvirtuous;

_ime dhammā sāvajjā_

(...) these teachings (_dhammā_) are denounced by the wise;

_ime dhammā viññugarahitā_

(...) when followed and taken up

_ime dhammā samattā samādinnā_

(...) these teachings (_dhammā_) lead to harm and suffering

_ahitāya dukkhāya saṃvattantīti_

(...) you should abandon them.

_atha tumhe kālāmā pajaheyyātha._
____

===== Dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati: certain objects of the systematic teachings

_Dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati_ in the _Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta_ is defined
in relation to five groups of systematic teachings:

[quote, M.1.59-62]
____
In this regard a bhikkhu abides contemplating the nature of certain objects of
the systematic teachings in respect of the (1) five hindrances... (2) the five
aggregates... (3) the six senses and their objects... (4) the seven
enlightenment factors... (5) the four noble truths.

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati pañcasu
nīvaraṇesu... pañcasupādānakkhandhesu... chasu ajjhattikabāhiresu
āyatanesu... sattasu bojjhaṅgesu... catusu ariyasaccesu._
____

But only the aggregates and sense bases really fit here, because the purpose of
_Satipaṭṭhāna_ is:

(1) to profoundly understand objects:

[quote, S.5.182]
____
As he abides contemplating the nature of certain objects of the systematic
teachings, those objects are profoundly understood.

_Dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke
abhijjhādomanassaṃ. Tassa dhammesu dhammānupassino viharato dhammā
pariññātā honti.._
____

The five aggregates are the objects to be profoundly understood:

[quote, S.3.26]
____
What things should be profoundly understood? The five aggregates.

_Katame ca bhikkhave pariññeyyā dhammā. Rūpaṃ bhikkhave pariññeyyo
dhammo... viññāṇaṃ pariññeyyo dhammo._
____

(2) to abandon fondness for and attachment to objects:

[quote, S.5.182]
____
As he abides contemplating the nature of certain objects of the systematic
teachings, whatever fondness he has for those objects of the systematic
teachings is abandoned.

_Tassa dhammesu dhammānupassino viharato yo dhammesu chando so pahīyati._
____

Objects where fondness and attachment are to be abandoned are the five
aggregates, the six senses, and the elements of sensation:

[quote, S.3.178]
____
You should abandon fondness for what is unlasting. What is unlasting? The five
aggregates.

_Yaṃ hi bhikkhave aniccaṃ tatra vo rāgo pahātabbo. Kiñca bhikkhave
aniccaṃ. Rūpaṃ bhikkhave aniccaṃ tatra vo rāgo pahātabbo...
Viññāṇaṃ aniccaṃ tatra vo rāgo pahātabbo._
____

[quote, S.4.149]
____
You should abandon attachment for what is unlasting. What is unlasting? The six
senses.

_Yaṃ bhikkhave aniccaṃ tatra vo rāgo pahātabbo. Kiñca bhikkhave
aniccaṃ. Cakkhuṃ bhikkhave aniccaṃ tatra vo rāgo pahātabbo... mano
anicco tatra vo rāgo pahātabbo._
____

[quote, S.4.145]
____
You should abandon fondness for what is unlasting. What is unlasting? The
elements of sensation.

_Yaṃ kho koṭṭhita aniccaṃ tatra te chando pahātabbo. Kiñca
koṭṭhita aniccaṃ. Cakkhuṃ kho koṭṭhita aniccaṃ tatra te chando
pahātabbo. Rūpā aniccā tatra te chando pahātabbo. Cakkhuviññāṇaṃ
aniccaṃ tatra te chando pahātabbo. Cakkhusamphasso anicco tatra te chando
pahātabbo. Yampidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ
vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi aniccaṃ tatra te chando
pahātabbo._
____

(3) to observe the cessation of objects. For example, in mindfulness with
breathing, the object of contemplation is said to be the fourth of the bases of
mindfulness:

[quote, S.5.325]
____
at that time he abides contemplating the nature of certain objects of the
systematic teachings.

_dhammesu dhammānupassī ānanda bhikkhu tasmiṃ samaye viharati._
____

Therefore, with mindfulness with breathing, one can parenthesise the
instructions as follows:

[quote, S.5.324]
____
He trains himself: I will breathe in... I will breathe out contemplating
(...) unlastingness [in relation to certain objects of the systematic teachings]

_Aniccānupassī assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti sikkhati_

(...) passing away [in relation to certain objects of the systematic teachings]

_virāgānupassī assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti sikkhati_

(...) ending [in relation to certain objects of the systematic teachings]

_nirodhānupassī assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti sikkhati_

(...) relinquishment [in relation to certain objects of the systematic teachings]

_paṭinissaggānupassī assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti sikkhati._
____

The practice of observing the cessation of objects is associated in the suttas
with the aggregates and the elements of sensation. It is not associated with
the hindrances, the enlightenment factors, or the noble truths. This is clearly
seen in the suttas beginning with the _Cakkhu Aniccānupassī Sutta_ (A.4.146),
and with the _Aniccānupassanā Sutta_ (A.5.359).

Therefore the _dhammesu dhammānupassī_ reflection concerns certain objects of
the systematic teachings, namely the five aggregates and the eighteen or more
elements of sensation.

===== Redundancy: dhammin, the phenomenon of

Where _dhammin_ means the phenomenon of, we treat it as redundant:

[quote, S.5.183]
____
He abides contemplating [co-conditional] disappearance in relation to the body,
vigorously, fully consciously, and mindfully, having eliminated greed and
dejection in regard to the world [of phenomena]

_Vayadhammānupassī kāyasmiṃ viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya

Comment:

Regarding the shift from plural _dhammā_ to singular _dhammaṃ_ translators
negotiate it differently.

- Horner ignores the singular and says 'any conditions... all the conditions'
(MLS.1.306).

- Bodhi ignores the plural and says 'nothing... everything' (MLDB.344).

- Woodward follows the cases, saying 'things... condition' (GS.4.53).

We regard the change in case to indicate a change in meaning.

knowing, I said 'I know'; though not seeing, I said 'I see.' I boasted vainly

reflecting on one's virtuousness as follows (_so iti paṭisaṃcikkhati_):

-- 'I harm no one at all, whether weak or strong. In both respects I have made
a lucky throw: since I am restrained in conduct of body, speech, and mind, and
since, with the demise of the body at death, I will be reborn in the realm of
happiness, in the heavenly worlds.'

one whose mind is rapturous, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he
experiences physical pleasure. Experiencing physical pleasure, his mind becomes
collected.'

_Dhātu_ can be rendered 'element' where it means constituent part, but
otherwise it is better called 'phenomenon.' In many cases, the word is

=== Na ca maṃ dhammādhikaraṇaṃ vihesesi

==== Renderings

- _na ca maṃ dhammādhikaraṇaṃ vihesesi_ (or _viheṭhesi_): he did not
trouble me through [failure to quickly understand] the teaching

==== Introduction

===== The Buddha's objection

On six occasions when disciples died, the Buddha spoke in homage of them,
saying that:

[quote, or _viheṭhesi_]
____
'He did not trouble me on account of the teaching.'

_na ca maṃ dhammādhikaraṇaṃ vihesesi._
____

Are we meant to understand from this that the Buddha objected to being
lengthily questioned on the teachings? Or objected to rude or pestering
disciples placing demands on his time and energy? We will show that neither of
these are the case, but rather, he was complaining about those who fail to
quickly penetrate the teaching. A good example of this would be Sāti:

[quote, M.1.257]
____
Although questioned, interrogated, and examined by those bhikkhus, the bhikkhu
Sāti, son of a fisherman, dogmatically grasping and stubbornly adhering to
that same odious dogmatic view, asserted:

_tadeva pāpakaṃ diṭṭhigataṃ thāmasā parāmassa abhinivissa voharati_

'As I understand the teaching explained by the Blessed One, it is this
personal _viññāṇa_ that roams and wanders the round of birth and death,
not another.'

_yathā tadevidaṃ viññāṇaṃ sandhāvati saṃsarati anaññan ti._
____

===== Time and energy consuming teachings

Firstly, all six occasions when our phrase was used involved the Buddha in
making himself available as a teacher, even visiting disciples in their homes.
So his complaint could not be about offering others his time and energy.
Indeed, some of these occasions involved extensive conversations, for example
with Puṇṇa (_Puṇṇovāda Sutta_, M.3.267) and Pukkusāti
(_Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta_, M.3.247). So when the Buddha praised Puṇṇa and
Pukkusāti for _na ca maṃ dhammādhikaraṇaṃ vihesesi_, it was obviously
not in reference to the amount of his time and energy they had consumed.

===== Two cases of nuisance

In two of our six cases, there was some actual nuisance involved.

1. Firstly, Bāhiya of the Bark Robe demanded an immediate explanation of the
teaching when the Buddha was on almsround. Twice he asked, and twice the Buddha
refused:
+
[quote, Ud.7]
____
This is not the right time, Bāhiya. We have entered the village for almsfood.

_akālo kho tāva bāhiya. Antaragharaṃ paviṭṭhamhā piṇḍāyā ti._
____
+
Only at the third request did the Buddha comply, standing there with his laden
almsbowl.

2. The second potential nuisance was with Pukkusāti, who later confessed lack
of respect:
+
[quote, M.3.246]
____
A transgression overcame me, bhante, in that, foolishly, stupidly, and badly
behaved, I presumed to address the Blessed One as 'friend.'

_accayo maṃ bhante accagamā yathābālaṃ yathāmūḷhaṃ yathā
akusalaṃ yohaṃ bhagavantaṃ āvusovādena samudācaritabbaṃ
amaññissaṃ._
____

Thus, when the Buddha praised Bāhiya and Pukkusāti for _na ca maṃ
dhammādhikaraṇaṃ vihesesi_, it was obviously not in reference to being
pressurised to teach at an inappropriate moment, nor was it in reference to the
lack of proper respect that he had been shown. We will see what the Buddha was
complaining about when we examine the _Kinti Sutta_.

===== Four cases of imperfect discipleship

In only two of our cases, with Puṇṇa and Bāhiya, did the Buddha's
instruction lead to arahantship. The other four cases led to non-returnership
or stream-entry, which is considered blameworthy because:

[quote, S.4.60]
____
He who lays down one body and takes up a new body is one I call blameworthy.

_yo kho sāriputta imañca kāyaṃ nikkhipati aññañca kāyaṃ upādiyati
tamahaṃ saupavajjoti vadāmi._
____

Thus, when the Buddha praised the brahman Brahmāyu, Pukkusāti, Dīghāvu, and
Suppabuddha for _na ca maṃ dhammādhikaraṇaṃ vihesesi_, it was obviously
not in reference to their blameworthiness in failing to attain arahantship
before rebirth.

===== Kinti Sutta

The expression _vihesā bhavissati_ is explained in the _Kinti Sutta_, which
says that when one bhikkhu admonishes another there may be problems for both
parties. The possible combination of problems is found in these reflections:

1. I will not be troubled, and the other person will not be distressed, for he
is not ill-tempered and resentful, and not strongly opinionated and
relinquishes his views readily.
+
****
_mayhañca avihesā bhavissati parassa ca puggalassa anupaghāto. Paro hi
puggalo akkodhano anupanāhī adaḷhadiṭṭhī suppaṭinissaggī._
****

2. I will not be troubled, but the other person will be distressed, for though
he is ill-tempered and resentful, he is not strongly opinionated and
relinquishes his views readily.
+
****
_mayhaṃ kho avihesā bhavissati parassa ca puggalassa upaghāto. Paro hi
puggalo kodhano upanāhī adaḷhadiṭṭhī suppaṭinissaggī._
****

3. I will be troubled, but the other person will not be distressed, for though
he is not ill-tempered and resentful, he is strongly opinionated and
relinquishes his views reluctantly.
+
****
_mayhaṃ kho vihesā bhavissati parassa ca puggalassa anupaghāto. +
****
Paro hi puggalo akkodhano anupanāhī daḷhadiṭṭhī duppaṭinissaggī._

4. I will be troubled, and the other person will be distressed, for he is
ill-tempered and resentful, and strongly opinionated and relinquishes his views
reluctantly.
+
****
_mayhañca kho vihesā bhavissati parassa ca puggalassa upaghāto. +
****
Paro hi puggalo kodhano upanāhī daḷhadiṭṭhī duppaṭinissaggī_
(M.2.241).

This shows that the Buddha would not be troubled by those who become angry and
resentful, but by those who are strongly opinionated and who relinquish their
views reluctantly. The same pattern is seen in our six cases, all of which
involve individuals who, though not necessarily arahants, nonetheless quickly
achieved high spiritual attainments. The six cases are enumerated below.

Thus, _vihesā bhavissati_ means slowness to comprehend a teaching. It shows
that what the Buddha appreciated from disciples was quick understanding. This
is confirmed when he said:

[quote, Vin.1.5]
____
If I were to explain the teaching to others and they did not understand, it
would be wearisome and troublesome for me.

_Ahañceva kho pana dhammaṃ deseyyaṃ pare ca me na ājāneyyuṃ so
mama'ssa kilamathe sā mama'ssa vihesā ti._
____

===== The six cases: quick understanding of the teaching

The six cases we refer to are these:

1. The brahman Brahmāyu became a non-returner before his death, which occurred
within days of meeting the Buddha (M.2.146).

2. Pukkusāti became a non-returner during his overnight teaching from the
Buddha, or on the following morning before his untimely death (M.3.247).

3. Puṇṇa became an arahant in his first rains residency period after
meeting the Buddha (M.3.270) (S.4.63).

4. Dīghāvu was already a stream-enterer when he asked the Buddha to visit him
on his deathbed, and became a non-returner before he died (S.5.346).

5. Bāhiya became an arahant immediately on being exposed to the teaching
(Ud.8-9).

6. Suppabuddha became a stream-enterer either while listening to his first
discourse on the teaching or immediately thereafter, before his untimely death
(Ud.50).

===== Failure to quickly understand the teaching: conclusion

The six cases suggest that 'to understand the teaching' means to achieve at
least stream-entry. To 'quickly understand' means either:

1. to achieve stream-entry while listening to one's first discourse, or

2. to achieve non-returnership within days of hearing one's first discourse, or

3. to achieve arahantship in one's first rains residency period.

=== Nandi; Nandati

==== Renderings

- _nandati_: to rejoice

- _nandi_: spiritually fettering delight

- _dhammanandi_: righteous spiritually fettering delight

==== Introduction

===== Renderings for nandi

_Nandi_ has been called:

- PED: 'joy, enjoyment, pleasure, delight in.'

- Norman: enjoyment (Sn.v.1115; 1055), joy (Sn.v.1101; 637), pleasure
(Sn.v.175).

- Bodhi: delight (M.3.32, S.2.101, A.2.11).

===== Nandi is spiritually fettering

We say _nandi_ is 'spiritually fettering' for four reasons:

1. Through its association with _saṃyojana_ ('bond [to individual
existence]'):
+
[quote, S.4.36]
____
Tethered [to individual existence] by the bond of spiritually fettering
delight, Migajāla, a bhikkhu is called 'one living with a partner.'

_nandisaṃyojanasaṃyutto kho migajāla bhikkhu sadutiyavihārī ti vuccati.
Taṇhā hissa dutiyā sāssa appahīnā tasmā sadutiya vihārīti vuccati._
____

2. Through its association with _upadānaṃ_ ('grasping'):
+
[quote, M.1.266]
____
Spiritually fettering delight in sense impression is grasping.

_Yā vedanāsu nandī tadupadānaṃ._
____

3. Through its association with _saṃyojano_ ('bond'):
+
[quote, Sn.v.1109]
____
Spiritually fettering delight is the bond of the world [by which it is tethered
to individual existence].

_Nandi saṃyojano loko._
____

4. Through its association with _rāgo_ ('attachment'):
+
[quote, S.4.36]
____
When there is spiritually fettering delight, there is attachment.

_nandiyā sati sārāgo hoti._
____

===== The objects of nandi

Spiritually fettering delight is usually associated with attractive objects,
but sometimes with hostile attitudes, as follows:

[quote, A.2.10]
____
spiritually fettering delight in sensuous pleasure

_kāmanandi._

spiritually fettering delight in views

_diṭṭhinandi._

spiritually fettering delight in individual existence _

_bhavanandi._
____

[quote, A.3.245]
____
spiritually fettering delight in ill will

_vyāpādanandī._

spiritually fettering delight in maliciousness

_vihesānandī._
____

[quote, A.3.246]
____
spiritually fettering delight in the refined material states of awareness

_rūpanandī._
____

[quote, A.3.246]
____
spiritually fettering delight in personal identity

_sakkāyanandī._
____

===== Dhammanandi: in those who practise the teaching

Spiritually fettering delight has a righteous form, _dhammanandi_ (righteous
spiritually fettering delight) that occurs in those who practise the teaching,
and, according to this quote, would be equivalent to clinging:

[quote, M.1.135]
____
Thus the teaching explained by me is comparable to a raft, being for the sake
of crossing [the flood of suffering], not for the sake of clinging to it. When
you know that the teaching explained by me is comparable to a raft, you should
abandon even what is righteous, how much more so what is unrighteous.

_evameva kho bhikkhave kullūpamo mayā dhammo desito nittharaṇatthāya no
gahaṇatthāya. Kullūpamaṃ vo bhikkhave dhammaṃ desitaṃ ājānantehi
dhammā pi vo pahātabbā pageva adhammā._
____

For example, see Illustrations below.

===== Nandati: not always unwholesome

The verb _nandati_ is not always unwholesome_._ For example, though an
unvirtuous bhikkhu rejoices (_nandati_) in schism, a sympathetic friend
rejoices (_nandati_) in your good fortune.

==== Illustrations

====
nandati

rejoice
====

[quote, Dh.v.18]
____
In this world he rejoices, having passed on he rejoices; the doer of
meritorious deeds rejoices in both places. He rejoices in the thought of having
done meritorious deeds. He further rejoices having gone to heaven.

Comment:

If _nandi_ is taken as unqualified 'delight,' as it usually is in translation,
this would be hard to explain because the Buddha has said he takes delight in
the woods (_svāhaṃ vane nibbanatho visallo eko rame aratiṃ vippahāyā
ti_, S.1.180) and said that the wise man should be delighted in the woods
(_dhīro vanante ramito siyā_, Sn.v.709-710). Venerable Revata said the
bhikkhu who would illuminate the Gosinga Grove would be one who takes pleasure
and delight in solitary retreat (_paṭisallāṇārāmo hoti
paṭisallāṇarato_ M.1.213). Taking delight in solitude (_suññāgāre
abhirati_) is regarded as a supernormal attainment.

=== Nahātaka

- _nahātaka_: spiritually cleansed

==== Introduction

===== Nahāta: externally bathed or spiritually cleansed

_Nahāta_ can mean externally bathing, or spiritually cleansing:

[quote, Vin.2.220-1]
____
By one who has bathed and is getting out (of the water), way should be made for
those who are getting into it.

===== Nahāna, bath, external or inward

_Nahāna_ can likewise be applied both externally and inwardly. When someone
told Nandaka, the minister of the Licchavis: 'It is time for your bath, sir'
(_nahānakālo bhante ti_) he replied:

[quote, S.5.390]
____
-- 'Enough now, I say, with that external bath. This internal bath will
suffice, namely, faith in the Blessed One.'

_Alaṃ dāni bhaṇe etena bāhirena nahānena. Alamidaṃ ajjhattaṃ
nahānaṃ bhavissati yadidaṃ bhagavati pasādo ti._
____

===== Nahātaka: religious connotations

By comparison, _nahātaka_ has only religious connotations, meaning
'spiritually cleansed' (Thī.v.251). The word is never applied to external
cleansing, and it always implies arahantship.

===== Ninhāta and ninhāya: religious connotations

Likewise, _ninhāta_ and _ninhāya_ have only religious connotations.
_Ninhāta_ (adj.) is _nis+nahāta_, where _nis_ means 'the finishing,
completion or vanishing of an action' (PED sv _ni_). _Ninhāya_ is not in PED,
but it is equivalent to _ninhāta_, and linked to _nahātaka_:

_Ninhāta_:

[quote, Th.v.348]
____
I have [now] cleansed away all demerit, I am free of [the three] spiritual
stains, of purified conduct, pure.

=== Nāccasārī na paccasārī

==== Renderings

- _nāccasārī na paccasārī_: neither longs for the cessation of individual
existence nor is unintent upon it

==== Introduction

===== Accasārī and paccasārī: occurrence

_Accasārī_ and _paccasārī_ occur in _Suttanipāta_ verses 8-13. Their
meaning is unsettled.

===== Accasārī and paccasārī: meaning

- _Accasārī_ is the aorist of _atisarati_, meaning 'to go too far.'

- _Paccasārī_ is the aorist of _paṭisarati_, meaning 'to stay back.'

===== Diṭṭhigata Sutta: oliyantī and atidhāvanti

Interpreting _nāccasārī na paccasārī_ in the light of the _Diṭṭhigata
Sutta_ (It.43) produces a convincing result. The _Diṭṭhigata Sutta_ opens
like this:

____
Through acquiescing in two wrong views [of reality], some devas and men hold
back, and some overreach.

_Dvīhi bhikkhave diṭṭhigatehi pariyuṭṭhitā devamanussā oliyantī eke
atidhāvanti eke._
____

Thus the comparable verbs in the _Diṭṭhigata Sutta_ are:

- _Atidhāvati_: to overreach

- _Oliyati_: to hold back

===== Diṭṭhigata Sutta: holding back

The _Diṭṭhigata Sutta_ explains holding back, like this:

[quote, It.44]
____
How do some hold back?

_Kathañca bhikkhave oliyanti eke?_

Devas and men find enjoyment, pleasure, and satisfaction in individual
existence.

_bhavārāmā bhikkhave devamanussā bhavaratā bhavasammuditā._

When the teaching is taught to them to put an end to individual existence,
their minds do not become energised, serene, settled, and intent upon it.

_tesaṃ bhavanirodhāya dhamme desiyamāne na cittaṃ pakkhandati na
pasīdati na santiṭṭhati nādhimuccati. Evaṃ kho bhikkhave olīyanti eko._
____

===== Diṭṭhigata Sutta: overreaching

The _Diṭṭhigata Sutta_ explains overreaching, as follows:

[quote, It.44]
____
How do some overreach?

_Kathañca bhikkhave atidhāvanti eke?_

Some people are revolted, appalled, and disgusted by individual existence.

_bhaveneva kho paneke aṭṭiyamānā harāyamāsā jigucchamānā_

They long for the cessation of individual existence

_vibhavaṃ abhinandanti_

saying that 'When that [absolute] Selfhood is annihilated, destroyed, and does
not exist with the demise of the body at death, this is peaceful, this is
sublime, this is reality.

_yato kira bho ayaṃ attaṃ kāyassa bhedā parammaraṇā ucchijjati
vinassati na hoti parammaraṇā etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ etaṃ
yathāvantī._
____

===== Conclusion

If _atisarati_ ('to go too far') and _paṭisarati_ ('to stay back') are
equivalent to _atidhāvati_ ('to overreach') and _oliyati_ ('to hold back'),
then the _Diṭṭhigata Sutta_ shows _accasārin_ and _paccasārin_ have the
following meaning:

- _Accasārin_: longing for the cessation of individual existence

- _Paccasārin_: being unintent upon the cessation of individual existence

===== Nāma: denomination, uncountable noun

_Nāma_ can also mean 'denomination':

[quote, S.1.39]
____
What has conquered everything? What is the most extensive thing? What is the
one thing that has everything under its control?

_Kiṃsu sabbaṃ addhabhavi kismā bhiyyo na vijjati +
Kissassa ekadhammassa sabbeva vasamanvagū ti_

(...) Denomination has conquered everything. Denomination is the most extensive
thing. Denomination is the one thing that has everything under its control._

_nāmaṃ sabbaṃ addhabhavi nāmā bhiyyo na vijjati +
Nāmassa ekadhammassa sabbeva vasamanvagū ti._
____

_Nāma_ cannot be called 'name' here ('Name is the one thing that has all under
its control'). The context requires an uncountable noun.

===== Nāmarūpam

In _nāmarūpam, nāma_ is defined like this:

[quote, M.1.53]
____
Sense impression, perception, intentionality, sensation, and the paying of
attention, are called _nāmaṃ_.

_Vedanā saññā cetanā phasso manasikāro idaṃ vuccatāvuso nāmaṃ._

PED says _visāra_ is 'spreading, diffusion, scattering,' which does not fit
here. We therefore take the meaning of _visāra_ from _sara_ because both stem
from the root sṛ. The meaning of _sarati_ is 'to go, flow, run, move along.'
_Sara_ is 'going, moving, following' (PED).

==== Introduction

===== Chāta: hungry

_Chāta_ means hungry. For example, 'hungry dog' (_chātā sunakhaṃ_
Th.v.509).

=== Nindā

==== Renderings

- _nindā_: criticism

- _nindati_: to criticise

- _anindita_: beyond criticism

==== Introduction

===== Nindā: criticism not blame

Praise and blame are wrongfully used as opposites in English, where praise's
opposite is in fact criticism. The problem is so deeply ingrained that
'blameworthy' actually means 'worthy of criticism,' and 'blameless' means 'not
worthy of criticism.' To understand _ninda_, we will first discuss the
difference between blame and criticism:

- Blame answers the question: 'Who or what is responsible for something bad?'
It involves no should's or shouldn'ts.

- Criticism means saying something should have been better, or should or
shouldn't have happened, or be the way it is.

===== Criticism and blame: illustration

We might either blame the cook (tell him he was responsible), or criticise him
(tell him he should have been better). And though we criticise the food (it
should have been better), we do not blame it, because it was not responsible.

===== Considering the Illustrations

Now let us consider the Illustrations to be presented below:

1. When the bhikkhu Kokālika accused bhikkhus of unvirtuous desires (S.1.150),
he was saying they should have been better. Therefore he was criticising them.
But he was not holding them responsible, so it was not a matter of blame.

2. When in _Dhammapada_ verse 227 a bhikkhu talked too much, people complained.
He should have been better. So it is criticism. And although the bhikkhu's
speech could be criticised (it should have been better) it cannot be blamed,
because it was not responsible.

3. In _Dhammapada_ verse 309, a man commits adultery. If people criticise him,
they would be saying he should not have done it. But if her character is
ruined, they could blame him, because he was responsible.

===== No Pāli word for blame

There is no Pāli word for 'to blame.' Buddhadatta's English to Pāli
Dictionary gives three words for blame: _upavadati, codeti_ and _nindati_.
These all in fact mean 'to criticise' or 'to reprove':

[quote, M.1.440]
____
If a bhikkhu does not fulfil the training in virtue, the Teacher criticises
(_upavadati_) him, his discerning wise companions in the religious life
criticise him, the devas criticise him, and he himself even criticises himself.

_satthāpi upavadati. Anuvicca pi viññū sabrahmacārī upavadanti. Devatāpi
upavadanti. Attāpi attānaṃ upavadati._
____

[quote, Vin.2.250]
____
If a bhikkhu is wanting to reprove another (_codetu_), having contemplated five
principles within himself he may do so:

_Codakenupāli bhikkhunā paraṃ codetukāmena pañca dhamme ajjhattaṃ
manasikaritvā paro codetabbo._

=== Nipaka; Nepakka

==== Renderings

- _nipaka_: mindful

- _nipaka_: aware

- _nepakka_: awareness

==== Introduction

===== The problem of nipaka

The meaning of _nipaka_ is unsettled. Translators render it as follows:

- PED: intelligent, clever, prudent, wise.

- Bodhi: worthy (M.3.154).

- Bodhi: alert (A.3.138).

- Norman: zealous (Sn.v.1038; Dh.v.328).

- Horner: intelligent (M.1.340).

- Horner: apt (Vin.1.350).

- Ireland: discerning (It.93).

_Nepakka_ (_nipaka's_ noun) is a quality that a good bhikkhu is keen to develop
(_satinepakke tibbacchando hoti_, D.3.253). Although 'discernment' would fit
well here as a quality to strive for, could a bhikkhu be fittingly described as
eager to develop zeal, or alertness, or intelligence?

===== Not discernment

Developing the quality of _nipaka_ is considered part of ethical conduct,
together with _sato_ (_sato ca nipako ca. Etadānuttariyaṃ bhante
purisasīlasamācāre_ D.3.107). This counts against _nipaka_ being
'discerning,' which is part of penetrative discernment not ethical conduct --
although this is somewhat unclear in the scriptures, because of the division
changes. For example, the _Mahāsīhanāda Sutta_ would place discernment under
_paññāsampadā_ (D.1.174), and _sato_ not under _sīlasampadā_ (D.1.172),
but under _cittasampadā_ (D.1.173). But nonetheless, the point is clear:
however the factors are divided, _nipaka_ is not part of _paññā_, so it is
not discernment.

===== Nipaka and sati

_Nipaka_ and _nepakka_ are repeatedly linked to _sati_. For example:

- 'There are bhikkhus who are _nipakā nipakavuttino_ who abide with their
minds well established in the [contemplation of the] four bases of mindfulness'
(_nipakā nipakavuttino te catusu satipaṭṭhānesu sūpaṭṭhitacittā
viharanti_ M.1.339). _Nipakā_ is therefore a quality of those who practise
_satipaṭṭhāna._

- 'A bhikkhu is mindful. He is possessed of paramount mindfulness and
_nepakka'_ (_bhikkhu satimā hoti paramena satinepakkena samannāgato_
D.3.267). Here, _nepakka_ is part of _satimā hoti._

This suggests that _sati_ and _nepakka_ both mean 'mindfulness,' though when
the words occur together, we call _nepakka_ 'awareness' and _nipaka_ 'aware.'

===== Adjective for conduct

Finding the correct word for _nipaka_ is again challenged where it is used as
an adjective for 'conduct.' Here, 'mindful' seems the only way to resolve the
translation:

[quote, M.1.339]
____
There are, Kandaraka, bhikkhus in this community of bhikkhus who are disciples
in training whose virtue is consistent, whose conduct is consistent, who are

==== Introduction

===== Nibbāna: not beyond words

To ask whether _nibbāna_ is either something or nothing is a question outside
the range of conception (_appapañcaṃ papañceti_) (A.2.161). But although
_nibbāna_ is beyond conception, it is clearly not beyond words, as is proven
by its many epithets.

===== Nibbāna: the via negativa

_Nibbāna_ can be named in positive terms, 'what it is,' the _via positiva_; or
in negative terms, 'what it is not,' the _via negativa_. For example, consider
the list of thirty-three epithets at S.4.368-373. The positives are, for
example, the Peaceful (_santañca_), the Sublime (_paṇītañca_), the
Auspicious (_sivañca_). The negatives are, for example, the Unoriginated
(_asaṅkhatañca_), the Uninclined (_anatañca_), freedom from perceptual
obscuration (_anāsavañca_).

But if _nibbāna_ is beyond conception, and therefore unapproachable by the
_via positiva_, we would not have expected this list to include positives,
except on one condition: that the positives are concealed negatives. That is,
we call _nibbāna_ 'peaceful' but mean 'free of unpeacefulness'; 'sublime' but
mean 'free of unsublimeness'; 'auspicious' but mean 'free of inauspiciousness.'
And so on.

===== Nibbuto: etymology

_Nibbuto_ is two words represented in Sanskrit by _nivṛta_, quenched, and
_nirvṛta_, motionless, both past participles of _vṛ_ (PED). Thus _nibbuto_
is the extinguishing of fire and also the spiritual quality of an arahant:

[quote, M.1.487]
____
the fire is extinguished

_aggi nibbuto._
____

[quote, M.2.237]
____
I am inwardly at peace

_nibbuto'ham._
____

===== Nibbuto means peace not quenching

The two meanings, 'extinguished' and 'inwardly at peace', are 'used
promiscuously in the one word because of their semantic affinity,' says PED.
Thus, referring to the arahant, _nibbuto_ is sometimes wrongly called
'quenched' but the scriptures do not support this. They do not say, for
instance, that in arahantship _rāgadosamoha_ or the _āsavas_ are quenched.
The Buddha said one should know _nibbuto_ as peace (_santī ti nibbutiṃ
ñatvā_ Sn.v.933) and other suttas support this, linking _nibbuto_ to peaceful
qualities, for example:

[quote, M.1.341]
____
inwardly at peace, freed from inward distress

_nibbuto sītibhūto._
____

[quote, M.1.323]
____
I obtain inward calm and inward peace

_labhāmi paccattaṃ samathaṃ labhāmi paccattaṃ nibbutin ti._
____

[quote, Sn.v.933]
____
Knowing inward peace as Peace

_santī ti nibbutiṃ ñatvā._
____

Likewise, _nibbuto_ is contrasted with unpeaceful qualities, for example:

[quote, "M.2.196, Dh.v.406"]
____
inwardly at peace amidst the violent

_attadaṇḍesu nibbutaṃ._
____

[quote, Th.v.1060]
____
Inwardly at peace amidst those who are tormented [by spiritual defilement]_

_ḍayhamānesu nibbuto._
____

Therefore in the context of arahantship _nibbuto_ means peace. Our term for
this is 'inwardly at peace' (adjective) or 'inward peace' (_nibbuti,_ noun).

===== Nibbāna and quenching

_Nibbāna_ shares the _vṛ_ root, and therefore like _nibbuto_, has two
meanings: quenching and the Untroubled.

[quote, S.1.159]
____
the quenching of a lamp

_pajjotasseva nibbānaṃ._
____

[quote, S.2.18]
____
one who has realised the Untroubled.

_nibbānappatto._
____

The confusion between meanings is made more probable when the scriptures
compare the attainment of arahantship (_vimokkho_) to the quenching
(_nibbāna_) of a flame. For example, the bhikkhunī Paṭācārā said:

[quote, Thī.v.116]
____
The deliverance of my mind was like the quenching of the lamp.

_padīpasseva nibbānaṃ vimokkho ahu cetaso._
____

But arahantship does not involve anything being quenched. The _nibbāna_ of
arahantship is repeatedly linked elsewhere to 'destruction.' For example:

[quote, Ud.32-3]
____
With the destruction of all forms of craving comes the complete passing away
and ending [of originated phenomena], _nibbāna_

_sabbaso taṇhānaṃ khayā asesavirāganirodho nibbānaṃ._
____

[quote, S.4.251]
____
The destruction of attachment, hatred, and undiscernment of reality: this is
called _nibbāna_.

_rāgakkhayo dosakkhayo mohakkhayo idaṃ vuccati nibbānan ti._
____

===== Nibbāna, peace and the Untroubled

Our rendering of _nibbāna_ as 'the Untroubled' stems firstly from its
relationship to our rendering for _nibbuto_ ('inwardly at peace'), and secondly
from the _Attadīpa Sutta_ (S.3.43) and the _Bhaddāli Sutta_ (M.1.446). Bodhi
translates the _Bhaddāli Sutta_ like this:

- 'Suppose a horse trainer obtains a fine thoroughbred colt. He first makes him
used to wearing the bit. While the colt is being made to get used to wearing
the bit, because he is doing something that he has never done before, he
displays some writhing, scuffling and trembling, but through constant
repetition and gradual practice, he becomes peaceful in that action (_so
abhiṇhakāraṇā anupubbakāraṇā tasmiṃ ṭhāne parinibbāyati_)'
(Bodhi, S.3.43).

Bodhi says 'the verb used here is the verbal form of _parinibbāna_ and could
be literally, though erroneously, translated, "He attains final _Nibbāna_ in
that action" (MLDB n.668). Although 'peaceful' indeed suits the context, the
via negativist would say 'untroubled.'

In the _Attadīpa Sutta_ (S.3.43) a bhikkhu accepts the changeable nature of
the five aggregates, and so is not agitated when they change. Therefore he
abides happily. The text says _sukhaṃ viharaṃ bhikkhu tadaṅganibbuto ti
vuccati_: 'a bhikkhu who abides happily is said to be untroubled in that
respect,' meaning with respect to the change of the aggregates. Bodhi, however,
says (CDB p.883) 'a bhikkhu who abides happily is said to be quenched in that
respect.' In the note to this (CDB p.1055 n.56) he says the phrase might have
been rendered '"one who has attained _Nibbāna_ in that respect" i.e. only in
regards to a particular freedom.' But if he had used 'peaceful,' as he did at
M.1.446, his translation would have read more naturally: 'a bhikkhu who abides
happily is said to be peaceful in that respect,' and this would have once again
supported our 'untroubled.'

===== Two aspects of nibbāna

The scriptures distinguish two aspects of _nibbāna_:

(1) the Untroubled-with-residue
+
****
_saupādisesā nibbānadhātu_
****

(2) the Untroubled-without-residue
+
****
_anupādisesā nibbānadhātu_
****

1. The Untroubled-with-residue involves the destruction of _rāgadosamoha_ by
the living arahant (_tassa yo rāgakkhayo dosakkhayo mohakkhayo ayam vuccati
saupādisesā nibbānadhātu_). Being 'with residue' means the arahant has
unperished sense faculties and therefore continues to experience what is
pleasing and displeasing, both pleasure and pain (_pañcindriyāni yesaṃ
avighātattā manāpāmanāpaṃ paccanubhoti sukhadukkhaṃ
paṭisaṃvedeti_) (It.38).

2. The Untroubled-without-residue refers to the passing away of the arahant,
for whom sense impression ceases (_tassa idheva bhikkhave sabbavedayitāni
anabhinanditāni sītibhavissanti_), who utterly abandons all modes of being
(_pahaṃsu te sabbabhavāni tādino_, It.38-9).
+
The Untroubled-without-residue is sometimes called 'final _nibbāna_,' but the
idea that the _nibbāna_ at death is somehow more 'final' than the
Untroubled-with-residue has no support in the scriptures.

===== Nibbāna and parinibbāna

_Parinibbāna_ is sometimes considered to be the _nibbāna_ attained by the
arahant at death, but the scriptures do not support this. For example, consider
these passages:

1. I make known the realisation of the Untroubled (_parinibbānaṃ_) through
having no grasping in this very lifetime.
+
****
_diṭṭheva dhamme... anupādā paññāpemī ti_ (A.5.65).
****

2. He who has realised the Untroubled (_parinibbānagato_) via a path made by
himself... he is a bhikkhu.
+
****
_Pajjena katena attanā parinibbānagato... sa bhikkhu_ (Sn.v.514).
****

The effect of the _pari_- prefix is explained like this:

- 'The prefix _pari_- converts the noun from the expression of a state into the
expression of the achievement of that state. Thus _nibbāna_ means the state of
release, _parinibbāna_ the attaining of that state' (Bodhi, CDB p.49).

This rule does not apply to verbs and past participles because the verbs are
never expressions of a state, whereas the past participles are always
expressions of a state. Our renderings are as follows:

1. Verbs:

- _nibbāyati_: to go out

- _parinibbāyati_: to become untroubled

- _parinibbāyati_: to realise the Untroubled

- _parinibbāyati_: to pass away to the Untroubled-without-residue

2. Past participles:

- _nibbuto_: quenched, extinguished

- _nibbuto_: inwardly at peace

- _nibbuto_: realised the Untroubled (standing, in verse, for _parinibbuto_)

- _parinibbuto_: realised the Untroubled

- _parinibbuto_: passed away to the Untroubled-without-residue

===== Parinibbuto: two meanings

_Parinibbuto_ means either:

1. realised the Untroubled, or

2. passed away to the Untroubled-without-residue

Consider the following quotes:

[quote, Th.v.1218]
____
He has realised the Untroubled. He awaits the inevitable hour [fully
consciously and mindfully].

_parinibbuto kaṅkhati kālaṃ._
____

[quote, S.3.26]
____
One is free of craving. One has realised the Untroubled.

_nicchāto parinibbuto._
____

[quote, D.2.141]
____
Here the Perfect One passed away to the Untroubled-without-residue

_idha tathāgato anupādisesāya nibbānadhātuyā parinibbuto ti pi._
____

===== Nibbuto: in verse

In verse, _parinibbuto_ is often abbreviated to _nibbuto_.

[quote, Sn.v.638]
____
One who has realised the Untroubled through being without grasping, he is what
I call a Brahman.

_anupādāya nibbuto tamahaṃ brūmi brāhmaṇaṃ._
____

But this point could be argued. For example, the passage would also make sense
if rendered 'One who is inwardly at peace through being without grasping.' But
the mention of Brahman (i.e. arahant) makes our rendering more likely.

Sometimes the context suggests that _nibbuto_ does not mean _parinibbuto_:

[quote, "M.2.196, Dh.v.406"]
____
Inwardly at peace amidst the violent

_attadaṇḍesu nibbutaṃ._
____

It makes less sense to render this: 'realised the Untroubled amidst the
violent.'

===== Nibbuti

_Nibbuti_ may or may not imply arahantship. For example:

[quote, M.1.323]
____
_labhāmi paccattaṃ samathaṃ labhāmi paccattaṃ nibbutin ti_

A bhikkhu knows that "When I pursue, develop, and cultivate this view, I obtain
inward calm and inward peace"

_imaṃ kho ahaṃ diṭṭhiṃ āsevanto bhāvento bahulīkaronto._
____

[quote, Th.v.586]
____
All his perceptually obscuring states are destroyed and he attains inward peace

_Khīyanti āsavā sabbe nibbutiñcādhigacchatī ti._
____

===== Non-Buddhist ascetics: highest happiness

For non-Buddhist ascetics, _nibbāna_ meant 'highest pleasure':

[quote, D.1.36]
____
When the _attā_ is enjoying itself, provided with and possessed of the five
varieties of sensuous pleasure, at that point it has attained to the highest
pleasure in this lifetime

_attā pañcahi kāmaguṇehi samappito samaṅgībhūto paricāreti ettāvatā
kho bho ayaṃ attā paramadiṭṭhadhammanibbānaṃ patto hotī ti._
____

===== Parinibbanti: to pass away to the Untroubled-without-residue

PED and Norman accept the spelling _parinibbanti_ without comment. The word
also occurs at A.4.98; Dh.v.126; It.93; Sn.v.765. The commentary to S.4.128
glosses _parinibbanti_ as _parinibbāyanti_.

[quote, S.4.128]
____
Those free of perceptually obscuring states pass away to the
Untroubled-without-residue.

=== Nibbidā; Nibbindati

==== Renderings

- _nibbidā_: disillusionment

- _nibbidā_: disillusionment [with sensuous pleasure]

- _nibbidā_: disillusionment [with originated phenomena]

- _nibbindati_: to be disillusioned

- _nibbindati_: to be disillusioned [with originated phenomena]

==== Introduction

===== With specified objects

_Nibbidā_ and _nibbindati_ often have specified objects. For example:

[quote, S.3.21]
____
disillusioned with bodily form

_rūpasmimpi nibbindati._
____

[quote, S.2.18]
____
disillusionment with old age and death

_jarāmaraṇassa ce bhikkhu nibbidāya._
____

===== With a broad specified object

Sometimes they have a broad specified object e.g. 'originated phenomena':

[quote, S.2.191]
____
disillusioned with all originated phenomena

_sabbasaṅkhāresu nibbindituṃ._
____

===== With a broad unspecified object due to abbreviation

Sometimes the object is unspecified due to abbreviation. For example, a bhikkhu
who realises the nature of the five aggregates becomes disillusioned with each
of them (_rūpasmimpi nibbindati... viññāṇasmimpi nibbindati_ S.3.21). The
sutta continues:

____
Being disillusioned, he is unattached.

_nibbindaṃ virajjati_
____

This _nibbindaṃ_ means 'being disillusioned with all five aggregates', which
are unspecified due to abbreviation.

===== With a broad object implied by context

Sometimes a broad object is indicated by the context. For example, in twenty
five years since his going forth [into the ascetic life], Venerable Sappadāsa
attained not a moment's inward peace, being oppressed by attachment to sensuous
pleasure (_kāmarāgena addito_). So he picked up a razor in order to cut a
vein:

[quote, Th.v.409]
____
Then proper contemplation arose in me. The danger [of sensuous pleasure] became
apparent [to me]; and disillusionment [with originated phenomena] was firmly
established [in me]

_Tato me manasikāro yoniso udapajjatha +
Ādīnavo pāturahu nibbidā samatiṭṭhatha._
____

[quote, Th.v.410]
____
(...) Whereupon my mind was liberated [from perceptually obscuring states].

_tato cittaṃ vimucci._
____

Because it led to arahantship, we take the object of _nibbidā_ to be
originated phenomena (_sabbasaṅkhārā_), not just sensuous pleasure.

===== Rendering a broad object: 'originated phenomena' or 'things'?

In the scriptures, the five aggregates are collectively called either
'originated phenomena' (_saṅkhārā_), or 'things' (_dhammā_), for example
in this quote:

[quote, M.1.228]
____
Bodily form... advertence is unlasting

_Rūpaṃ bhikkhave aniccaṃ... viññāṇaṃ aniccaṃ_

(...) Bodily form... advertence is void of personal qualities

_Rūpaṃ bhikkhave anattā... viññāṇaṃ anattā_

(...) All originated phenomena (_saṅkhārā_) are unlasting;

_sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā_

(...) All things (_dhammā_) are void of personal qualities

_sabbe dhammā anattā ti._
____

Therefore consider again the phrase we used above:

____
Being disillusioned, he is unattached.

_nibbindaṃ virajjati_
____

This could be rendered as either:

1. Being disillusioned [with all things], he is unattached [to all things].

2. Being disillusioned [with originated phenomena], he is unattached [to
originated phenomena].

For stylistic reasons we choose the latter, for example in this passage:

[quote, A.5.3]
____
For one who knows and sees things according to reality, there is no need to
harbour the aspiration: 'May I be disillusioned [with originated phenomena] and
unattached [to originated phenomena]':

_Yathābhūtaṃ bhikkhave jānato passato na cetanāya karaṇīyaṃ
nibbindāmi virajjāmī ti._

(...) It is quite natural that one who knows and sees things according to
reality, is disillusioned [with originated phenomena] and unattached [to
originated phenomena].'

_Dhammatā esā bhikkhave yaṃ yathābhūtaṃ jānaṃ passaṃ nibbindati
virajjati._

====

Then Yasa, having awoken sooner than usual saw his retinue asleep: one with a
lute in her arm, one with a tabor under her chin, one with a drum under her
arm, one with dishevelled hair, one who was dribbling, and others who were
muttering. One would think it was a charnel ground before one's eyes
(_hatthappattaṃ susānaṃ maññe_).

Seeing this, the danger [of sensuous pleasure] became apparent to him
(_disvānassa ādīnavo pāturahosi_). His mind was established in
disillusionment [with sensuous pleasure] (_nibbidāya cittaṃ saṇṭhāsi_)
(Vin.1.15).

Comment:

This disillusionment did not lead to arahantship, so we do not parenthesise it
'disillusionment [with originated phenomena].'

==== Introduction

===== Nimitta: phantasm

A phantasm is a mental representation of a sense object that one attaches to
and pursues:

[quote, M.3.225]
____
If a bhikkhu sees a visible object via the visual sense,

_cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā_

(...) and his mind pursues the phantasm of the visible object,

_rūpanimittānusāri viññāṇaṃ hoti_

(...) is tied to the sweetness of the phantasm of the visible object,

_rūpanimittassādagathitaṃ_

(...) then his mind is called 'distracted and scattered externally'

_bahiddhā viññāṇaṃ vikkhittaṃ visaṭanti vuccati._
____

===== Nimitta: not 'mental image'

Visual phantasms could be called 'mental images,' but not all phantasms are
visual, so 'image' is incorrect for _nimitta_. For example:

____
In hearing an audible object via the auditory sense, if his mind pursues the
phantasm of the audible object _

_Sotena saddaṃ sutvā saddanimittānusārī viññāṇaṃ hoti_

In knowing a mentally known object via the mental sense, if his mind pursues
the phantasm of the mentally known object _

_Manasā dhammaṃ viññāya dhammanimittānusāri viññāṇaṃ hoti_
____

===== Reification: overcome by focusing upon the unabiding phenomenon

Phantasms persist in the mind if sense objects are 'reified'; that is, if sense
objects are seen as real and unchanging. Phantasms are overcome by focusing
upon the unabiding phenomenon. This is the end of reification.

[quote, A.3.292]
____
It is impossible, friend, out of the question, that one might develop and
cultivate the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] by focusing upon
the unabiding [phenomenon], make it one's vehicle and practice, carry it out,
pursue it, and properly undertake it, yet the mind would still pursue
phantasms. There is no such possibility.

_Aṭṭhānametaṃ āvuso anavakāso yaṃ animittāya cetovimuttiyā
bhāvitāya bahulīkatāya yānīkatāya vatthukatāya anuṭṭhitāya
paricitāya susamāraddhāya atha ca panassa nimittānusārī viññāṇaṃ
bhavissati ti ti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati._

(...) For this is the liberation from all abiding phenomena, namely the
liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] by focusing upon the unabiding
[phenomenon]._

_Nissaraṇaṃ hetaṃ āvuso sabbanimittānaṃ yadidaṃ animittā
cetovimutti._
____

We will discuss the nature of the unabiding phenomenon below.

===== Nimitta: abiding phenomena

_Nimitta_ can mean 'abiding phenomenon,' which means a phenomenon that is
regarded as an actual, existing thing instead of an everchanging condition.
Abiding phenomena are illusions produced by attachment, hatred, and
undiscernment of reality (_rāgo kho bhante nimittakaraṇo doso
nimittakaraṇo moho nimittakaraṇo_, S.4.296-7). A meditator can choose to
not focus on abiding phenomena, and instead focus on 'the unabiding phenomenon'
(_animitta dhātu_ M.1.297). For fuller versions of the quotes here, see
Illustrations below.

===== Focusing upon the unabiding phenomenon equals perceiving the passing away and ending [of originated phenomena]

Focusing on the unabiding phenomenon (i.e. the _animittadhātu_) is equivalent
to perceiving the passing away and ending [of originated phenomena]. This can
be proven in four steps as follows:

1. Attaining the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] by focusing
upon the unabiding [phenomenon] (_animittāya cetovimuttiyā samāpattiyā_)
involves these steps:
+
[quote, M.1.297]
____
not focusing upon any abiding phenomenon

_sabbanimittānañca amanasikāro_

focusing upon the unabiding phenomenon

_animittāya ca dhātuyā manasikāro._
____

2. 'Any/all abiding phenomena' (_sabbanimittāni_) means the senses, their
objects, and the phenomena involved in sense impression, as this passage shows:
+
[quote, S.4.50]
____
He perceives all phenomena (_sabbanimittāni_) differently. He sees the visual
sense differently, he sees visible objects differently... .

_sabbanimittāni aññato passati cakkhuṃ aññato passati rūpe aññato
passati... mano aññato passati dhamme aññato passati manoviññāṇaṃ
aññato passati manosamphassaṃ aññato passati yampidaṃ mano
samphassapaccayā uppajjati sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā
tampi aññato passati._
____

3. Not focusing upon any abiding phenomenon (_sabbanimittānañca
amanasikāro_) is equivalent to the _etaṃ santaṃ_ reflection, as this
passage shows:
+
[quote, A.5.321]
____
A bhikkhu reflects thus: This is peaceful, this is sublime, namely: the
quelling of all originated phenomena, the relinquishment of the whole
phenomenon of attachment, the destruction of craving, the passing away [of
originated phenomena], the ending [of originated phenomena], the Untroubled.

_Idhānanda bhikkhu evaṃ manasikaroti: etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ
yadidaṃ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhakkhayo
virāgo nirodho nibbānan ti_

(...) In this way his winning of inward collectedness is such that though he does
not contemplate the visual sense or visible object... nor what is seen, heard,
sensed, cognised, attained, sought after, thought out by mind, all that he does
not contemplate, but yet he still contemplates.

_evaṃ kho ānanda siyā bhikkhuno tathārūpo samādhipaṭilābho yathā na
cakkhuṃ manasikareyya na rūpaṃ manasikareyya... yampidaṃ diṭṭhaṃ
sutaṃ mutaṃ viññātaṃ pattaṃ pariyesitaṃ anuvicaritaṃ manasā
tampi na manasikareyya manasi ca pana kareyyā ti._
____

4. The _etaṃ santaṃ_ reflection equals the perceptions of non-attachment to
and ending [of originated phenomena]. This is obvious in the passage in 3). The
following passages also show it:
+
[quote, A.5.110]
____
And what, Ānanda, is the perception of the passing away [of originated
phenomena]?

_virāgasaññā_

(...) In this regard, Ānanda, a bhikkhu... contemplates thus: This is peaceful,
this is sublime, namely: the quelling of all originated phenomena, the
relinquishment of the whole phenomenon of attachment, the destruction of
craving, the passing away [of originated phenomena], the Untroubled.

_etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ yadidaṃ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho
sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhakkhayo virāgo nibbānan ti._

What is the perception of the ending [of originated phenomena]?

_nirodhasaññā_

(...) In this regard, Ānanda, a bhikkhu... contemplates: This is peaceful, this
is sublime, namely: the quelling of all originated phenomena, the
relinquishment of the whole phenomenon of attachment, the destruction of
craving, the ending [of originated phenomena], the Untroubled.

_etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ yadidaṃ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho
sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhakkhayo nirodho nibbānan ti._
____

Thus focusing upon the unabiding phenomenon is equivalent to perceiving the
passing away and ending of originated phenomena.

===== Focusing upon the unabiding phenomenon means the disappearance of personal identity

That the _etaṃ santaṃ_ reflection, and therefore the _animittadhātu_, is
equivalent to the disappearance of the illusions of personal identity and
personal ownership, and of the proclivity to self-centredness is indicated in
the following passage:

[quote, A.1.133]
____
In this regard a bhikkhu reflects thus: This is peaceful, this is sublime,
namely: the quelling of all originated phenomena, the relinquishment of the
whole phenomenon of attachment, the destruction of craving, the passing away
[of originated phenomena], the ending [of originated phenomena], the Untroubled.

_Idhānanda bhikkhuno evaṃ hoti etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ yadidaṃ
sabbasaṅkārasamatho sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhakkhayo virāgo nirodho
nibbānanti._

(...) In this way his winning of inward collectedness would be such that
regarding this [wretched human] body together with its advertence he would have
no illusions of personal identity or personal ownership, and no proclivity to
self-centredness. Likewise in all external phenomena he would have no illusions
of personal identity or personal ownership, and no proclivity to
self-centredness.

_Evaṃ kho ānanda siyā bhikkhuno tathārūpo samādhipaṭilābho yathā
imasmiñca saviññāṇake kāye ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayā nāssu
bahiddhā ca sabbanimittesu ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayā nāssu_

(...) He would so enter and abide in the liberation [from attachment through
inward calm] and the liberation [from uninsightfulness] through penetrative
discernment, that he would have no illusions of personal identity or personal
ownership, and no proclivity to self-centredness.

_yañca cetovimuttiṃ paññāvimuttiṃ upasampajja viharato
ahaṅkāramamaṅkāramānānusayā na honti tañca cetovimuttiṃ
paññāvimuttiṃ upasampajja vihareyya._

'Today this dish pleased my master' or 'He reached for this one' or 'He took a
lot of this one' or 'He praised this one'_

_idaṃ vā me ajja bhattu sūpeyyaṃ ruccati imassa vā abhiharati imassa vā

That cook gains gifts of clothing, wages and bouses. Why? Because that wise,

ways of practice

[quote, A.1.256]
____
A bhikkhu who is applied to the higher mental states should focus on three ways
of practice not exclusively, but from time to time: inward collectedness,
effort, and detached awareness

_Adhicittamanuyuttena bhikkhave bhikkhunā tīṇi nimittāni kālena kālaṃ
manasikātabbāni kālena kālaṃ samādhinimittaṃ manasikātabbaṃ kālena
kālaṃ paggahanimittaṃ manasikātabbaṃ kālena kālaṃ
upekkhānimittaṃ manasikātabbaṃ._

If such a bhikkhu focuses exclusively on the practice of inward collectedness
it is likely that his mind will fall into indolence

_ekantaṃ samādhinimittaññeva manasikareyya ṭhānaṃ taṃ cittaṃ
kosajjāya saṃvatteyya_

If he focuses exclusively on the practice of effort it is likely that his mind
will fall into restlessness

_ekantaṃ paggahanimittaññeva manasikareyya ṭhānaṃ taṃ cittaṃ
uddhaccāya saṃvatteyya_

If he focuses exclusively on the practice of detached awareness it is likely
that his mind will be not properly collected for the destruction of
perceptually obscuring states

_ekantaṃ upekkhānimittaññeva manasikareyya ṭhānaṃ taṃ cittaṃ na

[quote, M.1.118-122]
____
A bhikkhu who is applied to the higher mental states should from time to time
focus on five ways of practice.

_Adhicittamanuyuttena bhikkhave bhikkhunā pañca nimittāni kālena kālaṃ
manasikātabbāni. Katamāni pañca?_

When a bhikkhu is focusing on some meditation object that arouses unvirtuous,
spiritually unwholesome thoughts connected with desire, hatred, and
undiscernment of reality

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhunā yaṃ nimittaṃ āgamma yaṃ nimittaṃ
manasikaroto uppajjanti pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi
dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi._

then he should focus on some other meditation object connected with what is
spiritually wholesome.

_tena bhikkhave bhikkhunā tamhā nimittā aññaṃ nimittaṃ
manasikātabbaṃ kusalūpasaṃhitaṃ_

then he should examine the danger of those thoughts, that they are spiritually
unwholesome, blameworthy, and have an unpleasant karmic consequence

_tena bhikkhave bhikkhunā tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ ādīnavo upaparikkhitabbo
itipime vitakkā akusalā itipime vitakkā sāvajjā itipime vitakkā
dukkhavipākāti_

then he should arouse unmindfulness and inattention towards those thoughts

_tena bhikkhave bhikkhunā tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ asati amanasikāro
āpajjitabbo._

then he should pay attention to the dynamic quality of those thoughts

_tena bhikkhave bhikkhunā tesaṃ vitakkānaṃ
vitakkasaṅkhārasaṇṭhānaṃ manasikātabbaṃ_

then he should beat down, restrain, crush mind with the mind

_tena bhikkhave bhikkhunā dante'bhidantamādhāya jivhāya tāluṃ āhacca
cetasā cittaṃ abhiniggaṇhitabbaṃ abhinippīḷetabbaṃ
abhisantāpetabbaṃ._

Thus, those unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome thoughts connected with desire,
hatred, and undiscernment of reality are abandoned.

Venerable MahāMoggallāna said this:

[quote, S.4.263-269]
____
'Here, friends, while I was alone in solitary retreat, a reflection arose in my
mind thus: 'It is said, "inward collectedness that is focused upon the
unabiding [phenomena]; inward collectedness that is focused upon the unabiding
[phenomena]." What now is the inward collectedness that is focused upon the
unabiding [phenomena]?'

_Animitto cetosamādhi animitto cetosamādhīti vuccati katamo nu kho animitto
cetosamādhī ti_

Then, friends, it occurred to me:

_Tassa mayhaṃ āvuso etadahosi_

In this regard a bhikkhu, by not focusing upon any abiding phenomenon,

_Idha bhikkhu sabbanimittānaṃ amanasikārā_

enters and abides in the inward collectedness that is focused upon the
unabiding [phenomena].

_animittaṃ cetosamādhiṃ upasampajja viharati_

This is called the inward collectedness that is focused upon the unabiding
[phenomena].

_ayaṃ vuccati animitto cetosamādhī ti._

Then, friends, by not focusing upon any abiding phenomenon,

_So khvāhaṃ āvuso sabbanimittānaṃ amanasikārā_

I entered and dwelt in inward collectedness that is focused upon the unabiding
[phenomena].

_animittaṃ cetosamādhiṃ upasampajja viharāmi_

While I abided therein my mind pursued phantasms.

_tassa mayhaṃ āvuso iminā vihārena viharato nimittānusārī viññānam
hoti_

Then, friends, the Blessed One came to me by means of psychic power and said:

_Atha kho maṃ āvuso bhagavā iddhiyā upasaṅkamitvā etadavoca_

'Moggallāna, Moggallāna, do not be negligent, brahman, in [practising] inward
collectedness that is focused upon the unabiding [phenomena].

_moggallāna moggallāna mā brāhmaṇa animittaṃ cetosamādhiṃ pamādo_

Steady your mind in inward collectedness that is focused upon the
unabiding [phenomena]

_animittena cetosamādhismiṃ cittaṃ saṇṭhapehi_

Concentrate your mind in inward collectedness that is focused upon the
unabiding [phenomena]

_animittena cetosamādhismiṃ cittaṃ ekodiṃ karohi_

Compose your mind in inward collectedness that is focused upon the
unabiding [phenomena]

_animitte cetosamādhismiṃ cittaṃ samādahāti._
____

Comment:

At D.3.249, it says that one who has developed _animitta cetovimuttī_, it is
impossible, out of the question, that his mind would pursue phantasms. So,
Moggallāna's attainment must have been weakly developed.

=== Niyāma

==== Renderings

- _niyāma_: the way [of rightness comprised of spiritually wholesome factors]

- _sammattaniyāmaṃ_: the way of rightness [comprised of spiritually
wholesome factors]

- _niyāmaṃ kusalesu dhammesu sammattaṃ_: the way of rightness comprised of
spiritually wholesome factors

==== Introduction

===== PED: definition

PED says _niyāma_ means 'way, way to an end or aim, esp. to salvation, right
way (_sammattaniyāma_); method, manner. practice.'

===== Niyāma: abbreviation

_Niyāma_ is an abbreviation that occurs only in verse. The expanded form seen
in prose is: _niyāmaṃ kusalesu dhammesu sammattaṃ._ Bodhi apparently
agrees, because, commenting on S.1.196, he says '_Niyāma_ here no doubt
represents _sammattaniyāma_,' which is the abbreviation used in prose.

===== Niyāma: in verse

In verse, _niyāma_ occurs in the following ways:

[quote, Verse: S.1.196]
____
They have reached and realised the way [of rightness comprised of spiritually
wholesome factors].

_niyāmagataddasā._

____

[quote, A.3.441]
____
he could enter the way of rightness [comprised of spiritually wholesome factors]

_sammattaniyāmaṃ okkamissatī._
____

===== Conclusion

From this we see:

1. _Niyāma_ is always 'entered' in prose, and always 'realised' in verse.

2. In prose, _niyāma_ is always associated with 'rightness' (_sammatta_), and
in translating verse, this term should be parenthesised.

3. Where, in prose, _kusalesu dhammesu_ is missing, it should be parenthesised.

===== 'Way of rightness comprised of spiritually wholesome factors': tautology

'Rightness' (_sammatta_) is defined as the tenfold path:

[quote, A.5.240]
____
There are these ten factors of rightness. Which ten? The tenfold path of right
factors.

_Dasa ime bhikkhave sammattā. Katame dasa: sammādiṭṭhi sammā saṅkappo
sammāvācā sammākammanto sammāājīvo sammāvāyāmo sammāsati
sammāsamādhi sammāñāṇaṃ sammāvimutti._
____

'What is spiritually wholesome' (_kusala_) is defined in the same way:

[quote, A.5.241]
____
What is spiritually wholesome? The tenfold path of right factors.

_katamañca bhikkhave kusalaṃ. Sammādiṭṭhi sammāsaṅkappo sammāvācā
sammākammanto sammāājīvo sammāvāyāmo sammāsati sammāsamādhi
sammāñāṇaṃ sammāvimutti._
____

Therefore 'the way of rightness comprised of spiritually wholesome factors' is
tautological.

=== Niyyāna

==== Renderings

- _niyyāna_: salvation

- _niyyāna_: deliverance [from suffering]

- _niyyānaṃ bhavati_: to march forth

==== Introduction

===== Niyyānaṃ bhavati: to march forth

In its unexalted sense, _niyyāna_ means 'going out, departure,' says PED, as
here:

[quote, D.1.9]
____
The king will march forth; the king will not march forth;

_raññaṃ niyyānaṃ bhavissati. Raññaṃ aniyyānaṃ bhavissati._
____

===== Niyyāna: salvation

For brahmans _niyyāna_ was the highest attainment, meaning union with Brahmā,
i.e. 'salvation':

[quote, D.1.235]
____
This indeed is the direct path, the straight way, which leads to salvation,
which leads the one who practises it to union with Brahmā.

_ayameva ujumaggo ayamañjasāyano niyyāṇiko niyyāti takkarassa
brahmasahavyatāya._
____

===== Niyyāna: deliverance [from suffering]

For Buddhists _niyyāna_ has three associations:

1. freedom from suffering (_dukkhā pamuccati_)

2. inward peace (_upasama_)

3. enlightenment (_sambodha_)

These associations support us calling _niyyāna_ 'deliverance [from
suffering].'

1. This I tell you: This deliverance [from suffering] for the world [of beings]
has been declared to you [by me] in accordance with truth. In this way [the
world of beings] is released from suffering.
+
****
_Etaṃ lokassa niyyānaṃ akkhātaṃ vo yathātathaṃ +
****
Etaṃ vo ahamakkhāmi evaṃ dukkhā pamuccati_ (Sn.v.172).

2. Where a teacher is not perfectly enlightened, the teaching is
ill-proclaimed, ill-expounded, and does not lead to deliverance [from
suffering], or to inward peace. It is expounded by one who is not perfectly
enlightened.

===== Niyyānika and saṃsāra

PED says _niyyānika_ means 'leading out (of _saṃsāra_),' but _niyyānika_
cannot be rendered as such because it is never in the suttas directly linked to
_saṃsāra_.

=== Nirodha

==== Renderings

- _nirodha_: ending

- _nirodha_: ending [of originated phenomena]

- _nirodhāya_: to put an end to

- _niruddho hoti_: is ended

- _nirujjhati_: to cease

- _nirodheti_: to put an end to, to be stopped

- _nirodhiko_: destructive

==== Introduction

===== Nirodha: ending not cessation

PED says _nirodha_ 'is synonymous with _nibbāna_ and _parinibbāna_; it may be
said to be even a stronger expression as far as the active destruction of the
causes of life is concerned.' _Nirodha_ is therefore better represented in
'ending' than 'cessation,' though some translators prefer to call it 'stopping':

[quote, "Horner, M.1.9"]
____
This is the stopping of anguish.

_ayaṃ dukkhanirodho ti._
____

[quote, "Norman, Sn.p.140"]
____
This is the stopping of misery

_ayaṃ dukkhanirodho._
____

===== Nirodho plus named object

_Nirodha_ always means the ending of something; it never means just 'ending.'
This is most obvious, of course, when it has a named object. For example, the
_Rahogata Sutta_ describes the 'successive ending of originated phenomena,'
calling it _anupubbasaṅkhārānaṃ nirodho_:

[quote, "Rahogata Sutta, S.4.217"]
____
The successive ending of originated phenomena is explained by me.

_mayā anupubbasaṅkhārānaṃ nirodho akkhāto_

(...) For one who attains first jhāna, speech is ended.

_paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ samāpannassa vācā niruddhā hoti_

(...) For one who attains second jhāna, thinking and pondering are ended...

_dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ samāpannassa vitakkavicārā niruddhā honti..._

(...) For one who attains the ending of perception and sense impression,
perception and sense impression are ended.

_saññāvedayitanirodhaṃ samāpannassa saññā ca vedanā ca niruddhā
honti_

(...) For a bhikkhu whose _āsavas_ are destroyed, attachment, hatred, and
undiscernment of reality are ended.

_Khīṇāsavassa bhikkhuno rāgo niruddho hoti doso niruddho hoti moho
niruddho hoti._
____

===== Nirodho means 'ending of the five aggregates'

Sometimes _nirodha_ occurs without a named object. This has always been
perplexing, because it once led Venerable Ānanda to question the Buddha on the
matter:

____
-- 'Bhante, it is said, 'Ending, ending.' Through the ending of what things is
ending spoken of?'

_Nirodho nirodho ti bhante vuccati katamesānaṃ kho bhante dhammānaṃ
nirodhā nirodho ti vuccatī ti?_

-- 'Bodily form, Ānanda, is unlasting, originated, and dependently arisen. It
is destined to be destroyed, to disappear, to pass away, to cease. Through its
ending, ending is spoken of.

_Rūpaṃ kho ānanda aniccaṃ saṅkhataṃ paṭiccasamuppannaṃ
khayadhammaṃ vayadhammaṃ virāgadhammaṃ nirodhadhammaṃ. Tassa nirodhā
nirodho ti vuccati_
____

The same is said about the other aggregates, and the sutta concludes:

[quote, S.3.24]
____
-- 'It is through the ending of these things, Ānanda, that ending is spoken
of.'

_Imesaṃ kho ānanda dhammānaṃ nirodho nirodho ti vuccatī ti._
____

Thus if _nirodha_ has no designated object, then this sutta says the five
aggregates are the object. Other suttas support this principle, though in
slightly different terms, as we will see.

===== Nirodho means 'ending of originated phenomena'

The _Anupubbanirodha Sutta_ (A.4.456) describes the same steps as the _Rahogata
Sutta_, but calls it _anupubbanirodho_ not _anupubbasaṅkhārānaṃ nirodho_,
where _nirodha_ (ending) is therefore an abbreviation for _saṅkhārānaṃ
nirodha_ (ending of originated phenomena). The conclusion to the sutta should
therefore be parenthesised accordingly:

[quote, A.4.456]
____
It is in reference to this that the successive ending [of originated phenomena]
is spoken of by the Blessed One.

_Ettāvatā pi kho āvuso anupubbanirodho vuttā bhagavatā._
____

===== Nirodho means 'ending of perception and sense impression'

The _Sattadhātu Sutta_ (S.2.151) links _nirodha_ to 'ending of perception and
sense impression'. Because this is likewise the final step in the _Rahogata
Sutta_, we can be sure that _nirodha_ again means the ending of originated
phenomena:

[quote, "Sattadhātu Sutta, S.2.151"]
____
The phenomenon of the ending of perception and sense impression is a phenomenon
attained with the ending [of originated phenomena].

_yāyaṃ bhikkhu saññāvedayitanirodhadhātu ayaṃ dhātu nirodhaṃ
paṭicca paññāyatī ti._
____

Thus although unnamed objects of _nirodha_ can be explained differently, for
example as the five aggregates, or as originated phenomena, the scriptures
consistently agree that _nirodha_ always has an object, and is never simply
'ending.'

===== Step-by-step ending, and continuous ending

When the _Rahogata Sutta_ describes the 'successive ending of originated
phenomena,' it is step-by-step ending:

[quote, "Rahogata Sutta, S.4.217"]
____
For one who attains first jhāna, speech is ended. For one who attains
second jhāna, thinking and pondering are ended.

_paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ samāpannassa vācā niruddhā hoti dutiyaṃ
jhānaṃ samāpannassa vitakkavicārā niruddhā honti..._
____

But _nirodha_ can also mean ending as a continuous process:

[quote, A.4.146]
____
In this regard, some person in relation to the visual sense abides
contemplating ending, perceiving ending, experiencing ending continuously,
without a break, uninterruptedly, intent upon it mentally, penetrating it with
penetrative discernment

_idha bhikkhave ekacco puggalo cakkhusmiṃ nirodhānupassī viharati
nirodhasaññī nirodhapaṭisaṃvedī satataṃ samitaṃ abbokiṇṇaṃ
cetasā adhimuccamāno paññāya pariyogāhamāno._
____

===== The goal of practice: ending

Where _nirodha_ is the goal of one's practice, _nibbida_ is often included in
the formula, as follows:

[quote, S.4.4]
____
The noble disciple is indifferent to the visual sense of the past, he does not
long for the visual sense of the future, he applies himself to disillusionment
with the visual sense of the present, to non-attachment to it, and to the
ending of it.

_sutavā ariyasāvako atītasmiṃ cakkhusmiṃ anapekkho hoti; anāgataṃ
cakkhuṃ nābhinandati paccappannassa cakkhussa nibbidāya virāgāya
nirodhāya paṭipanno hoti._
____

[quote, It.44]
____
Devas and men find enjoyment, pleasure, and satisfaction in individual
existence. When the teaching is taught to them to put an end to individual
existence, their minds do not become energised, serene, settled, and intent
upon it.

_bhavārāmā bhikkhave devamanussā bhavaratā bhavasammuditā. Tesaṃ
bhavanirodhāya dhamme desiyamāne na cittaṃ pakkhandati na pasīdati na
santiṭṭhati nādhimuccati._
____

===== Practising for the ending of objects

The idea of practising for the ending of objects is shown in the following two
quotes to involve not delighting (_anabhinanditāni_):

1. Just as an oil lamp burns because of oil and a wick, and with the exhaustion
of the oil and wick it is extinguished through lack of fuel, so too,
bhikkhus... a bhikkhu knows that with the demise of the body, and with the
ending of life, all sense impression being not delighted in will be dissipated
right here in this world.

In this regard, one does not take delight in, welcome, or persist in cleaving.

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu nābhinandati nābhivadati nājjhosāya tiṭṭhati._
____

===== Ablative nirodhā: 'from' or 'with'

The ablative _nirodhā_ occurs in the reverse sequence of _paṭiccasamuppāda_
(called _paṭiloma_ at Ud.2). The Ablative shows motive, cause, reason, and
can be translated by 'for,' 'on account of,' 'by reason of,' 'through' (PGPL,
600 xi). We render it as 'with.' For example:

[quote, S.2.8-9]
____
With (=on account of) the ending of birth comes the ending of old age and death.

_Jātinirodhā jarāmaraṇanirodho ti._
____

[quote, S.2.48]
____
With (=on account of) the ending of nourishment, what is brought about is
destined to cease

_Tadāhāranirodhā yaṃ bhūtaṃ taṃ nirodhadhamman ti._
____

===== Ablative nirodhā: 'to put an end to'

The ablative 'shows motive, cause, reason,' says Duroiselle (para 600, xi),
therefore _nirodhā/nirodhāya_ can mean 'to put an end to.' For example:

[quote, Thī.v.458]
____
To put an end to craving for states of individual existence, allow me to go
forth [into the ascetic life].

_Bhavataṇhāya nirodhā anujānātha pabbajissāmi._
____

[quote, A.1.100]
____
To put an end to attachment, two things should be developed. Which two? Inward

===== Attachment of the mind: views and egocentric thoughts

The _Sundarikabhāradvāja Sutta_ says:

[quote, Sn.v.470]
____
'He who has abandoned the attachment of the mind [to views and egocentric
thoughts], in whom there is no possessiveness at all, not grasping anything in
either this world or the world beyond: the Perfect One is worthy of the
oblation.

_Nivesanaṃ yo manaso ahāsi pariggahā yassa na santi keci +

That the attachment of the mind is to views and egocentric thoughts is
supported by the commentary and the suttas:

1. Commentary: _taṇhādiṭṭhinivesanaṃ_. The notion "I am" and other
egocentric thoughts are imbued with _taṇhā_, says the _Taṇhājālinī
Sutta_ (A.2.212-3).

2. 'Objects of attachment' is linked in the following quote to views and
thoughts that are regarded as personal.

[quote, Sn.v.846]

One who is blessed with profound knowledge has no conceit about any view or
thought because he does not regard them as endowed with personal qualities.
Such a person is not to be gauged by his conduct, nor by his learning. He is

==== Introduction

===== Diṭṭhinissaya means diṭṭhi

PED says _diṭṭhinissaya_ means 'the foundation of speculation.' But the
scriptures treat _diṭṭhinissaya_ as a synonym of _diṭṭhi_. For example,
in this passage _nānādiṭṭhi_ (in _nānādiṭṭhikā_) is synonymous
with _nānādiṭṭhinissaya_:

[quote, Ud.67]
____
At that time there were a number of non-Buddhist ascetics living around
Sāvatthī. And they were of various dogmatic views, various persuasions,
various inclinations, attached to various dogmatic views... '

_nānādiṭṭhikā nānākhantikā nānārucikā
nānādiṭṭhinissayanissitā._
____

Similarly, in the next passage, when the Buddha asked what are the
_diṭṭhinissayā_ about the past, he answered in terms of doctrines and
views (_evaṃ vādino evaṃ diṭṭhino_), as if in English one might answer
a question about viewpoints in terms of views. The passage is this:

[quote, D.3.137]
____
Cunda, what are those views connected with the past that I have explained to
you as they should be explained? There are certain ascetics and Brahmanists
whose doctrine and dogmatic view is this: 'The _attā_ and _loko_ are eternal;
this alone is true, all else is false.'

_Katame ca te cunda pubbantasahagatā diṭṭhinissayā ye vo mayā vyākatā
yathā te vyākātabbā? Santi kho cunda eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṃ
vādino evaṃ diṭṭhino sassato attā ca loko ca idameva saccaṃ
moghamaññan ti._
____

===== Other translators

Some translators render _diṭṭhinissaya_ as 'dependence on view' or 'support
of views,' with convoluted results. For instance, consider this passage:

[quote, M.1.137-8]
____
-- 'Bhikkhus, you might best rely on that dogmatic view, relying on which there
would not arise grief, lamentation, physical pain, psychological pain, and
vexation. But do you see any such view?'

_Taṃ bhikkhave diṭṭhinissayaṃ nisseyyātha yaṃsa diṭṭhinissayaṃ
nissayato na uppajjeyyuṃ sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā. Passatha no
tumhe bhikkhave taṃ diṭṭhinissayaṃ yaṃsa diṭṭhinissayaṃ
nissayato na uppajjeyyuṃ sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā ti._

-- 'No, bhante.'

_No hetaṃ bhante_

-- 'Good, bhikkhus. I also see no such view relying on which there would not
arise grief, lamentation, physical pain, psychological pain, and vexation.'

_Sādhu bhikkhave. Ahampi kho taṃ bhikkhave diṭṭhinissayaṃ na
samanupassāmi yaṃsa diṭṭhinissayaṃ nissayato na uppajjeyyuṃ
sokaparidevadukkhadomanassupāyāsā._
____

Horner translates the last sentence as: 'Neither do I see that dependence on
view by depending on which dependence of view there would not arise grief,
suffering, anguish, lamentation, despair' (MLS.1.177).

===== Pitfalls

The negatives of the _nissaya nissāya nissita_ group are associated with a
range of pitfalls. For instance, _issita_ means 'giving offence.' Its negative
is _anissita_ (i.e. '_an-issita'_ not '_a-nissita'_):

[quote, S.4.179]
____
Not causing offence, not tormenting others, one who has realised the
Untroubled, a bhikkhu would not abuse anyone.

_Anissito aññamaheṭhayāno parinibbuto na upavadeyya kañciti._
____

The following passage has been quietly misleading us for centuries:

[quote, "S.2.280, A.2.51"]
____
Venerable Visākha was instructing the bhikkhus with speech that was polished,
well enunciated, articulate, making the meaning clear, comprehensive, not
causing offence.

_poriyā vācāya vissaṭṭhāya anelagalāya atthassa viññāpaniyā
pariyāpannāya anissitāyā ti._
____

However, Buddhaghosa's commentary says the speech was 'unattached to the round
of rebirth' (_vaṭṭaṃ anissitāya_) (PTS: AA.3.90). Another translator
simply says the bhikkhu's speech was 'unattached.'

The correct root of a negative is easier to recognise when paired with its
positive. For instance, if '_issāya'_ means 'of envy,' _anissāya_ clearly
means 'of non-envy' (_an-issāya_). For example, here:

[quote, A.1.94]
____
Possessed of two qualities one lives miserably: envy and stinginess.

_issāya ca macchariyena ca_

Possessed of two qualities one lives happily: non-envy and non-stinginess.

_anissāya ca amacchariyena ca._
____

===== Humour

_Nissita's_ different meanings make it an easy source of humour. For instance
the Buddha said that Brahmanists and householders are helpful in providing
bhikkhus with robe material, almsfood, abodes, and therapeutic requisites; and
bhikkhus are helpful in return by explaining the teaching. He said householders
and ascetics are each supported by the other (_aññoññanissitā_ It.111). A
bhikkhu preacher might well remind his audience that this does not mean
householders and ascetics are 'each attached to each other'
(_aññoññanissitā_) but instead they both should try to 'each not give
offence to each other' (_aññoññanissitā_).

From time to time a bhikkhu approaches those bhikkhus who are learned, to whom
the tradition has been handed down, experts in the teaching and discipline and
summaries, and asks and interrogates them 'How is that, bhante? What does that
mean?' Thus those Venerables can reveal what is hidden and clarify what is
obscure, and dispel his unsureness about various matters that are cause for
unsureness (A.1.118).

____
On what grounds, bhante, is a bhikkhu endowed with spiritual resources?

_Kittāvatā nu kho bhante bhikkhu nissayasampanno hotī ti._

If, either with the help of faith [in the perfection of the Buddha's
transcendent insight], or with the help of shame of wrongdoing, or with the
help of fear of wrongdoing, or with the help of energetic application [to the
practice], or with the help of wisdom, a bhikkhu abandons what is spiritually
unwholesome and develops what is spiritually wholesome, that which is
spiritually unwholesome is indeed abandoned.

_saddhañce... hiriñce... ottappañce... viriyañce... paññañce bhikkhu
bhikkhu nissāya akusalaṃ pajahati kusalaṃ bhāveti pahīnamevassa taṃ

[according to reality], is not attached; and who has no craving for either
individual existence or the cessation of individual existence.

[quote, Sn.v.752-3]
____
One who is free of attachment does not tremble.

_Anissito na calati_

But one who is attached,

_nissito ca_

Grasping states of individual existence in this world or another

_upādiyaṃ itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṃ_

Does not transcend the round of birth and death.

_saṃsāraṃ nātivattati_

Recognising this danger,

_Etamādīnavaṃ ñatvā_

That there is great peril in states of attachment,

_nissayesu mahabbhayaṃ_

Then, unattached, free of grasping, the bhikkhu should mindfully fulfil the
ideals of religious asceticism.

_Anissito anupādāno sato bhikkhu paribbaje ti._
____

Comment:

Norman says: 'Knowing this peril, that "There is great fear in dependences," a
bhikkhu should wander, not dependent nor grasping.' But _anissito_ and
_anupādāno_ appear as synonyms, which makes 'unattached, not grasping' more
likely than 'not dependent nor grasping.'

In this regard a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness (...
detached awareness) which conduces to seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and
spiritually unwholesome factors], to non-attachment [to originated phenomena],
to the ending [of originated phenomena], and which results in the
relinquishment [of the whole phenomenon of attachment].

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu satisambojjhaṅgaṃ bhāveti (...
upekkhāsambojjhaṅgaṃ bhāveti) vivekanissitaṃ virāganissitaṃ

In this way, dependent upon virtue, established upon virtue, a bhikkhu develops
and cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment.

_Evaṃ kho bhikkhave bhikkhu sīlaṃ nissāya sīle patiṭṭhāya satta
bojjhaṅge bhāveti satta bojjhaṅge bahulīkarotī ti._
____

Comment:

There are five reasons why _nissitaṃ_ does not mean 'supported by.'

1. Given that the sutta says the _bojjhaṅgā_ are brought to development
through virtue, it would be discordant in the same sutta to say that the
_bojjhaṅgā_ are 'supported by' _viveka virāga_ and _nirodha_.

2. What the _bojjhaṅgā_ are 'supported by' is explained in the
_Bojjhaṅgasaṃyuttaṃ_: virtue (S.5.63), listening to the teaching
(S.5.67), developing the [contemplation of the] four bases of mindfulness
(S.5.73), virtuous friendship (S.5.78), proper contemplation (S.5.79), and
diligence [in the practice] (S.5.91).

3. The Nibbidā Sutta (S.5.82) says seven factors of enlightenment when
developed and cultivated lead to _ekantanibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya
upasamāya abhiññāya sambodhāya nibbānaya saṃvattanti_. This list makes
it clear that _virāga_ and _nirodha_ are goals of the practice, not supports
for it.

4. The factors of the eightfold path are similarly called _vivekanissitaṃ
virāganissitaṃ nirodhanissitaṃ vossaggapariṇāmiṃ_ (S.5.54). To
propose that social activites like right speech, right conduct and right means
of livelihood are 'supported by' or 'based upon' _viveka virāga_ and _nirodha_
is obviously untrue.

5. Bodhi says that 'the terms 'seclusion' (_viveka_), 'dispassion'
(_virāga_), and 'cessation' (_nirodha_) may all be understood as referring
to Nibbāna. Their use in this context signifies that the development of the
enlightenment factors is directed to Nibbāna' (MLDB p.1172 n.48).

By three means, a brigand robs, plunders, burgles, and ambushes.

_Tīhi bhikkhave aṅgehi samannāgato mahācoro sandhimpi chindati nillopampi

He relies on the inaccessible, the impenetrable, and the powerful.

_visamanissito ca hoti gahananissito ca hoti balavanissito ca hoti._

How does a brigand rely on the inaccessible?

_Kathañca bhikkhave mahācoro visamanissito hoti._

He relies on impassible rivers and mountains hard to climb.

_idha bhikkhave mahācoro nadīviduggaṃ vā nissito hoti pabbatavisamaṃ vā._

How does a brigand rely on the impenetrable?

_Kathañca bhikkhave mahācoro gahananissito hoti._

He relies on jungles of grass or trees, or thickets, or woodland groves.

gedhaṃ vā pana vanasaṇḍaṃ._

How does a brigand rely on the powerful?

_Kathañca bhikkhave mahācoro balavanissito hoti_

He relies on kings or kings' ministers (_rājānaṃ vā rājamahāmattānaṃ
vā nissito hoti_), thinking that if anyone accuses him, these people will say
what is useful in defence, and they do so.

_idha bhikkhave mahācoro rājānaṃ vā rājamahāmattānaṃ vā nissito

In the same way, an unvirtuous bhikkhu possessed of three qualities (_tīhi
dhammehi samannāgato_) wanders about hurting and injuring himself; he is
blameworthy, criticised by the wise, and begets much demerit. What are the
three?

In this regard, an unvirtuous bhikkhu relies on the crooked, the impenetrable
and the powerful.

_visamanissito ca hoti gahananissito ca balavanissito ca._

How does an unvirtuous bhikkhu rely on the crooked?

_Kathañca bhikkhave pāpabhikkhu visamanissito hoti._

In this regard, an unvirtuous bhikkhu is possessed of crookedness in deeds of
body, speech, and mind.

_idha bhikkhave pāpabhikkhu visamena kāyakammena... vacīkammena...
manokammena samannāgato hoti._

How does an unvirtuous bhikkhu rely on the impenetrable?

_Kathañca bhikkhave pāpabhikkhu gahananissito hoti_

In this regard, the unvirtuous bhikkhu has a wrong view [of reality]. He is
possessed of an unenlightening doctrine.

_idha bhikkhave pāpabhikkhu micchādiṭṭhiko hoti antaggāhikāya
diṭṭhiyā samannāgato_

How does an unvirtuous bhikkhu rely on the powerful?

_Kathañca bhikkhave pāpabhikkhu balavanissito hoti_

He relies on kings or kings' ministers thinking that if anyone accuses him, the
kings or kings' ministers will defend him. And they do so.

==== Illustrations: nissita, attached

===== Introduction

In the following group of contexts, I take _nissita_ to mean 'attached' not
'dependent' for two reasons:

1. Because _nissita_ is frequently linked to other words implying grasping:
_upādāya, upādiyati, chandarāgaṃ, paṭibaddho,_ and _saṃyutto_. For
example:
+
[quote, Sn.v.752]
____
One who is attached, grasping states of individual existence in this world or
another does not transcend the round of birth and death

_nissito ca upādiyaṃ +
Itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṃ saṃsāraṃ nātivattati._
____
+
[quote, D.2.292]
____
And he (practising _satipaṭṭhāna_ mindfulness) abides unattached, not
grasping anything in the world

_anissito ca viharati na ca kiñci loke upādiyati._
____

2. Secondly, certain of these contexts do not support 'dependent.' For
instance, it seems more sensible to say a bhikkhu is free of attachment to
nourishment of all kinds (_sabbāhāramanissito_: Sn.v.749) than to say he is
not dependent on them. Being not attached to food does not mean not dependent.
Similarly, it seems more sensible to say a bhikkhu is not attached to the past
(_pubbamantamanissito_: Sn.v.849) than to say he is not dependent on the past,
as Norman puts it.

=== Nekkhamma

==== Renderings

- _nekkhamma_: unsensuousness

- _nekkhamma_: the practice of unsensuousness

- _nekkhamma_: unsensuous

==== Introduction

===== Etymology

The derivation of _nekkhamma_ is uncertain. PED says it may be derived from:

1. _Nikkhamati_ 'to go forth from, to come out of, to get out, issue forth,
depart' (PED).

2. _Nikkāma_: 'without craving or lust, desireless' (PED).

But in actual useage it contrasts sensuousness. This suggests a derivation from
_Nikkāma_ in the meaning 'without sensuous pleasure.' This fits the following
quotes:

1. Three spiritually unwholesome ways of thought: sensuous thought,
unbenevolent thought, malicious thought. Three spiritually wholesome ways of
thought: unsensuous thought, benevolent thought, compassionate thought.
+
****
_Tayo akusalasaṅkappā: kāmasaṅkappo vyāpādasaṅkappo
vihiṃsāsaṅkappo. Tayo kusalasaṅkappā: nekkhammasaṅkappo
avyāpādasaṅkappo avihiṃsāsaṅkapo_ (D.3.215).
****

2. The deliverance from sensuous pleasure, that is, the practice of
unsensuousness.
+
****
_kāmānametaṃ nissaraṇaṃ yadidaṃ nekkhammaṃ_ (D.3.275).
****

===== Renunciation and the practice of unsensuousness

_Nekkhamma_ is usually called 'renunciation,' which implies the renouncing of
things unnecessary to the religious life. But _nekkhamma_ must surely involve
not having those things in the first place. It seems better represented by the
term 'the practice of unsensuousness.' These terms fit with the way in which
_nekkhamma_ is paired in the suttas.

===== Paired with seclusion from sensuous pleasure

_Nekkhamma_ is paired in the scriptures with:

[quote, A.4.233]
____
seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors]

A bhikkhu, secluded from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome

sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors]... fourth jhāna.

This is called the pleasure of the practice of unsensuousness, the pleasure of
meditative seclusion, the pleasure of inward peace, the pleasure of
enlightenment. This pleasure should be pursued, developed, and cultivated, I
declare. It should not be feared.

seclusion, the pleasure of inward peace, the pleasure of enlightenment.

In this regard, when a bhikkhu is contemplating sensuous pleasure, his mind is

contemplating the practice of unsensuousness his mind becomes energised,

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhuno kāmaṃ manasikaroto kāmesu cittaṃ na pakkhandati

When his mind is well-directed, well-developed, has completely emerged from
sensuous pleasure, been liberated and emancipated from it, then whatever
vexatious and anguishing perceptually obscuring states that arise due to
pursuing sensuous pleasure, he is freed from them. He does not experience that
sense impression. This is called deliverance from sensuous pleasure.

=== No c'assa no ca me siyā

==== Renderings

- _no c'assa no ca me siyā_: had it not been, it would not have been "mine"

- _na bhavissati na me bhavissati_: it will be not; not "mine" will it be

- _yadatthi yaṃ bhūtaṃ taṃ pajahāmī ti_: that which is, that which is
brought about, that I abandon

==== Introduction

===== Assa and siyā: renderings

_Assa_ and _siyā_ are optative forms of _atthi_, meaning either:

1. 'if he were or should be' (PGPL, section 510).

2. 'it might be' (DOP, sv _atthi_).

===== Assa: alternative renderings

_Assa_ can also be rendered as:

1. 'it would be' i.e. the conditional simple tense. For example:
+
[quote, D.2.225]
____
'May the Blessed One live for a long time, free of sickness and illness! That
would be for the welfare and happiness of the manyfolk'

_tadassa bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya._
____

2. 'it would have been' i.e. the conditional perfect progressive tense. For
example, if the Buddha were to die prematurely, Venerable Sāriputta said he
would think:
+
[quote, S.2.274]
____
'If the Blessed One had lived for a long time, that would have been for the
welfare and happiness of the manyfolk'

_sace hi bhagavā ciraṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ tiṭṭheyya tadassa
bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya._
____

===== Ca/ca connective

1. The truncated c' in the first line of the formula stands for _ca_ not _ce_
because it is part of the _ca/ca_ connective. This usually means 'and... and,'
but not here as we will see.

2. Bodhi says 'The commentaries take the truncated particle c' to represent ce,
"if," and interpret the two parts of the formula as conditionals' (NDB note
1532). Thus he says the commentaries would render the opening phrase: 'If it
had not been, it would not be mine.'

3. Bodhi says 'I dissent from the commentaries on the meaning of c', which I
take to represent ca (="and"). The syntax of the phrase as a whole requires
this.' By which he means the syntax of a _ca/ca_ connective requires this.
Bodhi thus assumes the _ca/ca_ connective has but one meaning: 'and... and.'
But Norman says: '_ca_ in the sense of "if" is common in Pāli' (EVI n.37).

===== Ca and the conditional sense

PED says _ca_ has four meanings:

\(a) indefinite sense (with a demonstrative pronoun) e.g. _yañ ca kho ceteti_:
whatever he thinks.

\(b) connective sense: 'and, then, now.'

\(c) disjunctive sense: 'but.'

\(d) conditional sense: 'if,' 'might,' 'may.'

Examples of conditional _ca_ are as follows:

===== Examples of conditional ca: 'if'

PED gives an example of _ca_ in its conditional sense ('if'), which is
especially noteworthy because it is part of a _ca/ca_ connective:

[quote, J.5.216]
____

_Sakko ca me varaṃ dajjā so ca labbhetha me varo._

[quote, S.1.190]
____
-- Come now, bhikkhus, let me invite you (to censure me): might there not be

we would censure.

____

===== The trailer phrase

Occasionally a trailer phrase is added to the _no c'assa_ formula, as follows:

[quote, A.4.75]
____
'That which is, that which is brought about, that I abandon'

_yadatthi yaṃ bhūtaṃ taṃ pajahāmī ti._
____

This second phrase is a logical progression of the first phrase:

1. If it had not been (_no c'assa_)

2. I abandon that which is (_yadatthi_)

===== The application of the no c'assa reflection

[quote, S.3.57]
____
The _Udāna Sutta_ (S.3.57) says the _no c'assa_ reflection concerns the five
aggregates. That is, with the cessation of the five aggregates, a bhikkhu
reflects that had the aggregates not been, they would not have been "mine."
They will be not; not "mine" will they be.' See Illustrations below.

_So rūpassa vibhavā vedanāya vibhavā saññā vibhavā saṅkhārānaṃ
vibhavā viññāṇassa vibhavā evaṃ kho bhikkhu no cassaṃ no ca me siyā
nābhavissa na me bhavissatī ti evaṃ adhimuccamāno bhikkhu chindeyya
orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanānī ti._
____

For the ignorant Everyman, this reflection arouses terror (_tāsaṃ āpajjati_
S.3.57).

===== The Annihilationists formula

A similar formula is ascribed to annihilationists. Its slight distortion
implies the view "I will be destroyed," as follows:

____
'Had I not been, it would not have been "mine." I will be not, not "mine" will
it be'

_no c'assaṃ no ca me siyā na bhavissāmi na me bhavissatī ti._
____

This annihilationist attitude can be similarly applied to the five aggregates.

With the cessation of the five aggregates, a bhikkhu reflects thus.

_So rūpassa vibhavā... viññāṇassa vibhavā evaṃ kho bhikkhu_

-- 'Had it not been, it would not have been "mine." It will be not; not "mine"
will it be.'

_no c'assa no ca me siyā na bhavissati na me bhavissatī ti_

A bhikkhu intent upon liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] in this

==== Introduction

===== Paccaya: 'dependent on'

In some cases we have rendered _paccaya_ as 'dependent on.' For example:

[quote, M.1.262]
____
Dependent on birth, there arises old-age-and-death.

_Jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇan ti._
____

Others translate this as:

- Horner: Conditioned by birth is ageing and dying

- Bodhi: With birth as condition, ageing and death.

Norman translates _paccaya_ as 'because of':

[quote, Sn.v.735]
____
Whatever misery arises, all this is because of contact.

_yaṃ kiñci dukkhaṃ sambhoti sabbaṃ phassapaccayā ti._
____

PED says: 'literally resting on, falling back on, foundation; cause, motive
etc. 1. support, requisite, means, stay. 2. reason, cause, ground, motive,
means, condition.' It says ablative _paccayā_ means 'of, through, by reason
of, caused by.'

===== Abstract formula of dependent origination

That _paccaya_ means dependent can be seen in abstract formula of dependent
origination, as follows:

[quote, S.2.70]
____
When there is this, that comes to be. With the arising of this, that arises.
Without this, that does not come to be. With the ending of this, that ceases.

_iti imasmiṃ sati idaṃ hoti imassuppādā idaṃ uppajjati imasmiṃ asati
idaṃ na hoti imassa nirodhā idaṃ nirujjhati._
____

If this formula is applied to _jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇan ti_ it leads to the
following statements:

- When there is birth, old age and death come to be. With the arising of birth,
old age and death arise. Without birth, old age and death do not come to be.
With the ending of birth, old age and death ceases.

This well supports us rendering _jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇan ti_ as 'Dependent
on birth, there arises old-age-and-death,' though other translations are
clearly possible.

=== Pacchāpuresaññī

==== Renderings

- _pacchāpuresaññī_: perceiving the constant nature of reality

- _pacchāpuresaññā_: the perception of the constant nature of reality

==== Introduction

===== Pacchāpuresaññī: background

_Pacchāpuresaññī_ is a form of meditation that occurs as part of the
development of the four paths to psychic power (_catusu iddhipādesu_). It
therefore leads to both the attainment of various kinds of psychic power
(_anekavihitaṃ iddhividhaṃ_) and the destruction of perceptually obscuring
states (_āsavānaṃ khayā_, S.5.282).

It was also a meditation taught to Venerable MahāMoggallāna to overcome
torpor, to be used in conjunction with walking meditation:

[quote, A.4.87]
____
Perceiving the constant nature of reality, concentrate on pacing back and
forth, your senses inwardly immersed, your mind not straying outwards. It is
possible that by abiding in this way, that the torpor will be abandoned

_pacchāpuresaññī caṅkamaṃ adhiṭṭheyyāsi antogatehi indriyehi
abahigatena mānasena. Ṭhānaṃ kho panetaṃ vijjati yaṃ te evaṃ
viharato taṃ middhaṃ pahīyetha._
____

This meditation is analysed in the commentary, but Bodhi says its 'explanation
sounds strained' (CDB p.1946 n.272).

===== Pacchā and pura: physically behind and in front

One problem is that _pacchā_ and _pura_ can refer to either space or time. For
example, it is an offence for the one who is walking behind on a path
(_pacchato gacchanto_) to explain the teaching to someone walking in front
(_purato gacchantassa_) (Vin.4.205). According to this, _pacchāpuresaññī_
would involve meditating on 'what is physically behind and in front.'

===== Pacchā and pura: past and future

But _pacchā_ and _pura_ can also refer to time:

1. 'First' and 'afterwards': one can ridicule others of saying first what they
should have said afterwards, or afterwards what they should have said first
(_pure vacanīyaṃ pacchā avaca. Pacchā vacanīyaṃ pure avaca_ D.1.8).

2. 'Past' and 'what is in the future': some people wish for what is in the
future or the past, longing for present and former pleasures (_pacchā pure
vāpi apekkhamānā ime va kāme purime va jappaṃ_ Sn.v.773).

===== Yathā pure tathā pacchā

The term _pacchāpuresaññī_ is explained by the reflection _yathā pure
tathā pacchā; yathā pacchā tathā pure._ If we take _pacchā_ and _pura_ as
referring to time, it leads to the following translation:

[quote, S.5.277]
____
He abides perceiving the constant nature of reality: 'As what is past, so what
is to come; as what is to come, so what is past.'

_pacchāpuresaññī ca viharati: yathā pure tathā pacchā yathā pacchā
tathā pure._
____

This is further explained as follows:

[quote, S.5.277]
____
And how does a bhikkhu abide perceiving the constant nature of reality: 'As
what is past, so what is to come; as what is to come, so what is past'? In this
regard, the perception of the constant nature of reality is correctly grasped
by the bhikkhu, correctly contemplated, correctly pondered, correctly
penetrated by penetrative discernment.

_Kathañca bhikkhave bhikkhu pacchāpure saññī ca viharati? Yathā pure
tathā pacchā yathā pacchā tathā pure. Idha bhikkhave bhikkhuno pacchā
pure saññā suggahitā hoti sumanasikatā sūpadhāritā suppaṭividdhā
paññāya._
____

===== Sāriputta: either later or sooner

The last passage should be compared to Venerable Sāriputta saying:

[quote, Th.v.1004]
____
Either way this [life ends in] death, not no death, either later or sooner.

_Ubhayenamidaṃ maraṇameva nāmaraṇaṃ pacchā vā pure vā._
____

This supports our saying that _pacchāpuresaññī_ means the perception of the
constant nature of reality. The near future and the distant future have the
same mortal nature. In this respect the present is no different from any other
time period.

===== Pārājika recitation: 'defeated' until the time of his death

The same conclusion can be drawn from the Pārājika recitation, which
concludes that a bhikkhu who commits a pārājika offence is no longer in
communion with the bhikkhus:

[quote, Vin.3.109]
____
'The four rules that merit expulsion have been recited. If a bhikkhu
commits any of them, he is no longer in communion with the bhikkhus. As in the
near future, so in the distant future, he is expelled, not in communion.'

_Uddiṭṭhā kho āyasmanto cattāro pārājikā dhammā. Yesaṃ bhikkhu
aññataraṃ vā aññataraṃ vā āpajjitvā na labhati bhikkhuhi saddhiṃ
saṃvāsaṃ yathā pure tathā pacchā pārājiko hoti asaṃvāso_
____

This illustrates 'the constant nature of reality': the bhikkhu's status as
'expelled' is the same from the time of the offence until the time of his
death: he cannot be reinstated.

===== Comparing present past and future in the scriptures

The idea of comparing the present to the past and the future is
well-established in the scriptures. For instance:

[quote, M.3.18-9]
____
Whatever bodily form, past, future, or present... one should see all bodily
form with perfect penetrative discernment as this is "not [in reality] mine" etc

_Yaṃ kiñci rūpaṃ atītānāgatapaccuppannaṃ ajjhattaṃ vā bahiddhā
vā oḷārikaṃ vā sukhumaṃ vā hīnaṃ vā paṇītaṃ vā yaṃ dūre
santike vā sabbaṃ rūpaṃ n'etaṃ mama n'eso'hamasmi na me so attā ti._
____

[quote, M.3.219]
____
Formerly as well as now all these visible objects are unlasting

_pubbe ceva rūpā etarahi ca sabbe te rūpā aniccā._
____

===== Dhammaṭṭhitatā: comparison

[quote, S.2.25]
____
And what is dependent origination? Old-age-and-death arises dependent on birth.
Whether or not there is an arising of Perfect Ones, there persists that
phenomenon, that stability in the nature of reality, that orderliness in the
nature of reality, that specific conditionality.

_Katamo ca bhikkhave paṭiccasamuppādo? Jātipaccayā bhikkhave
jarāmaraṇaṃ uppādā vā tathāgatānaṃ anuppādā vā tathāgatānaṃ
ṭhitāva sā dhātu dhammaṭṭhitatā dhammaniyāmatā idapaccayatā._
____

[quote, A.1.286]
____
Whether or not there is an arising of Perfect Ones, there persists that
phenomenon, that stability in the nature of reality, that orderliness in the
nature of reality, [namely] the unlastingness of all originated phenomena.

_Uppādā vā bhikkhave tathāgatānaṃ anuppādā vā tathāgatānaṃ
ṭhitāva sā dhātu dhammaṭṭhitatā dhammaniyāmatā sabbe saṅkhārā
aniccā ti._
____

===== Conclusion

The reflection on _pacchāpuresaññī_ suggests that one should contemplate
the constant nature of reality. Although reality is inconstant, its nature is
constant.

And he abides perceiving the constant nature of reality: 'As what is past, so

attitude open and unclouded, he makes his mind radiant.

COMMENT

- 'As below, so above,' as explained in the _Vibhaṅga Sutta_ (S.5.277), means
one reviews bodies from head to toe as being full of various foul things (_idha
bhikkhave bhikkhu imameva kāyaṃ uddhaṃ pādatalā adho kesamatthakā
tacapariyantaṃ pūraṃ nānappakārassa asucino paccacekkhati_).

- 'As by day, so by night,' says the _Vibhaṅga Sutta_, means one practises
the meditation similarly, during the day and during the night.

==== Introduction

===== Pajānāti: three meanings

We render _pajānāti_ as either:

1. to 'discern'

2. to 'know that'

3. to 'understand how'

For examples, see Illustrations, grouped accordingly.

===== Paññā: wisdom or penetrative discernment

_Paññā_ is etymologically and functionally related to _pajānāti._ Where it
linked to conduct of body and speech we call it wisdom. Where it is linked to
conduct of mind we call it penetrative discernment.

===== Paññā: 'wisdom' or 'one who is wise'

When _paññā_ is linked to a person we usually call it wisdom, especially if
it is:

1. given a prefix like _mahā-_ or _bhūri-_ e.g. _bhūripañño_

2. accompanied by terms _paṇḍito_ or _mahāpurisa_ e.g. _paṇḍito
mahāpañño_

For example:

[quote, A.2.179]

And what is old age and death?_

_Katamañca bhikkhave jarāmaraṇaṃ?_

The ageing, decrepitude, broken teeth, graying hair, wrinkled skin, dwindling
of the life-span, decay of the sense faculties for the various beings in the
various classes of beings. This is called old age.

_yā tesaṃ tesaṃ sattānaṃ tamhi tamhi sattanikāye jarā jīraṇatā
khaṇḍiccaṃ pāliccaṃ valittacatā āyuno saṃhāni indriyānaṃ
paripāko ayaṃ vuccati jarā._

The passing away, the deceasing, the dissolution, the ending, the perishing,
the death, the breaking up of aggregates, the laying down of the body for the
various beings in the various classes of beings. This is called death.

_yā tesaṃ tesaṃ sattānaṃ tamhā tamhā sattanikāyā cuti cavanatā
bhedo antaradhānaṃ maccu maraṇaṃ kālakiriyā khandhānaṃ bhedo
kaḷevarassa nikkhepo jīvitindriyassa upacchedo idaṃ vuccati maraṇaṃ._

Thus this is old age, and this is death. This is called old age and death.

_Iti ayañca jarā idañca maraṇaṃ idaṃ vuccati bhikkhave
jarāmaraṇaṃ. ṇaṃ_

With the origination of birth comes the origination of old age and death

_jātisamudayā jarāmaraṇasamudayo_

With the ending of birth comes the ending of old age and death

_jātinirodhā jarāmaraṇanirodho_

The practice leading to the ending of old age and death is the noble
eightfold path.

_ayameva ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo jarāmaraṇa nirodhagāminī
paṭipadā seyyathidaṃ -- sammādiṭṭhi... pe... sammāsamādhi_

_evaṃ jarāmaraṇasamudayaṃ pajānāti_

the ending of old age and death

_Kathañca bhikkhave bhikkhu suvimuttapañño hoti:_

In this regard a bhikkhu knows that his attachment... hatred... undiscernment
of reality is abandoned, chopped down at the root, completely and irreversibly
destroyed, never to arise again in future.

=== Paññuttara

==== Renderings

- _paññuttara_: penetrative discernment is the examiner

- _paññuttara_: penetrative discernment as the examiner

==== Introduction

===== Dictionaries

_Uttara_ means:

- DOP: 'chief result or characteristic; what is left; excess.'

- PED: 'having something above or higher, having a superior.'

But neither explanation fits the contexts of _paññuttara_. We will show that
_uttara_ means 'examiner.'

===== Translators

Bodhi says the commentary 'does not explain in what sense _paññā_ is called
_uttarā,'_ and renders _paññuttarā sabbe dhammā_ as 'Wisdom is of all
things their supervisor' (Bodhi, A.4.339).

===== Sikkhānisaṃsa Sutta

The _Sikkhānisaṃsa Sutta_ (A.2.243) shows that the meaning of
_paññuttaraṃ_ can be derived from _paññāya samavekkhitā honti_:

[quote, A.2.243]
____
In accordance with way I explain the teachings to disciples for the complete
destruction of suffering, those teachings are examined by them with penetrative
discernment (_paññāya samavekkhitā honti_). In this way penetrative
discernment is the examiner (_paññuttaraṃ hoti_).

_Yathā yathā bhikkhave mayā sāvakānaṃ dhammā desitā sabbaso sammā
dukkhakkhayāya tathā tathāssa te dhammā paññāya samavekkhitā honti.
Evaṃ kho bhikkhave paññuttaraṃ hoti._
____

This suggests that _uttaraṃ_ can be named after _samavekkhati_, for which PED
says:

- _Samavekkhati_: to consider, examine.
- _Samavekkhitar_: one who considers.

This supports our term for _paññuttarā._

=== Paṭinissaggānupassī assasissāmī ti sikkhati

==== Renderings

- _paṭinissaggānupassī assasissāmī ti sikkhati_: He trains himself: 'I
will breathe in contemplating relinquishment [in relation to certain objects of
the systematic teachings]

==== Introduction

===== Paṭinissagga's usual objects

_Paṭinissagga_ usually has a specified object in the genitive case. For
example:

1. Views: relinquishment of views
+
****
_diṭṭhīnaṃ paṭinissaggo hoti_ (M.1.40).
****

2. Attachment: Relinquishment of the whole phenomenon of attachment
+
****
_sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo_ (A.3.164).
****

3. Craving: The relinquishment of all forms of craving
+
****
_sabbaso taṇhānaṃ... paṭinissaggā_ (M.1.6).
****

===== Paṭinissagga's objects during contemplation

When _paṭinissagga_ is for contemplation, it usually has a specified object
in the locative case. For example:

1. The visual sense (_cakkhu_): In this regard, some person in relation to the
visual sense abides contemplating relinquishment, perceiving relinquishment,
experiencing relinquishment continuously, without a break, uninterruptedly,
intent upon it mentally, penetrating it with penetrative discernment
+
****
_Idha bhikkhave ekacco puggalo cakkhūsmiṃ paṭinissaggānupassī viharati
paṭinissaggasaññī paṭinissaggapaṭisaṃvedī satataṃ samitaṃ
abbokiṇṇaṃ cetasā adhimuccamāno paññāya pariyogāhamāno_ (A.4.146;
A.4.13).
****

2. Sense impression: Whatever sense impression he experiences whether pleasant,
unpleasant, or neutral, in relation to that sense impression he abides...
contemplating relinquishment
+
****
_yaṃ kiñci vedanaṃ vedeti sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā
so tāsu vedanāsu... paṭinissaggānupassī viharati_ (M.1.251).
****

3. The body and pleasant sense impression: He abides contemplating
relinquishment in relation to the body and pleasant sense impression.
+
****
_so kāye ca sukhāya ca vedanāya... paṭinissaggānupassī viharati_
(S.4.211).
****

===== Paṭinissagga in mindfulness with breathing

However, in mindfulness with breathing _paṭinissagga_ occurs without an
object:

____
He trains himself: 'I will breathe in... I will breathe out contemplating
relinquishment.

_paṭinissaggānupassī assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti sikkhati_
____

The object of contemplation in this case is said to be the fourth of the bases
of mindfulness, which we have explained (sv _Dhamma_) means 'certain objects of
the systematic teachings.' Therefore we translate as follows:

[quote, S.5.325]
____
When a bhikkhu is training himself to breathe in and breathe out contemplating
relinquishment, at that time he abides contemplating the nature of certain
objects of the systematic teachings.

_Yasmiṃ samaye ānanda bhikkhu... paṭinissaggānupassī assasissāmī ti
sikkhati paṭinissaggānupassī passasissāmī ti sikkhati dhammesu
dhammānupassī ānanda bhikkhu tasmiṃ samaye viharati._
____

Objects of the systematic teachings are therefore the objects when
contemplating relinquishment during mindfulness with breathing, and they should
be regarded as a locative:

[quote, S.5.324]
____
I will breathe in... I will breathe out contemplating relinquishment [in
relation to certain objects of the systematic teachings]

_paṭinissaggānupassī assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti sikkhati._
____

===== Dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati: objects of the systematic teachings

Objects of the systematic teachings given in the _Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta_ are:

[quote, M.1.59-62]
____
In this regard a bhikkhu abides contemplating the nature of certain objects of
the systematic teachings in respect of the five hindrances... the five
aggregates... the six senses and their objects... the seven enlightenment
factors... the four noble truths.

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati pañcasu
nīvaraṇesu... pañcasupādānakkhandhesu... chasu ajjhattikabāhiresu
āyatanesu... sattasu bojjhaṅgesu... catusu ariyasaccesu._
____

But only the aggregates and sense bases really fit here. For discussion of this
point, see Glossary sv _Dhamma_.

the realisation through transcendent insight of whatever condition is
realisable through transcendent insight, and become an eye-witness in every
case, if there is the practice of spiritual development.

Within two weeks of my ordination I attained analytical insight into the

_Addhamāsūpasampannena me āvuso atthapaṭisambhidā sacchikatā odhiso

Within two weeks of my ordination I attained analytical insight into the
teachings with their divisions and features;

_Addhamāsūpasampannena me āvuso dhammapaṭisambhidā sacchikatā odhiso

Within two weeks of my ordination I attained analytical insight into the use of
conventional expressions with their divisions and features;

_Addhamāsūpasampannena me āvuso niruttipaṭisambhidā sacchikatā odhiso

Within two weeks of my ordination I attained analytical insight into intuitive
knowledge with its divisions and features;

_Addhamāsūpasampannena me āvuso paṭibhānapaṭisambhidā sacchikatā
odhiso vyañjanaso._
____

Comment:

Bodhi says the last analytical insight 'seems to refer to the ability to
spontaneously apply the other three types of knowledge to clearly communicate
the Dhamma.'

This ability is illustrated in the _Bhūta Sutta_ (S.2.47-50) and the
_Kaḷāra Sutta_ (S.2.51-6) when the Buddha asked Sāriputta about _The
Questions of Ajita._ Sāriputta hesitated because he had not previously
considered the issue (_pubbe appaṭisaṃviditaṃ_). But when the Buddha
prompted him and then approved of his answer, Sāriputta said:

[quote, S.2.55]
____
If the Blessed One had for seven days and nights questioned me about the matter
in various ways and manners, then for seven days and nights I would have been
able to answer him in various ways and manners.

_Satta rattindivāni cepi maṃ bhagavā etamatthaṃ puccheyya aññamaññehi
padehi aññamaññehi pariyāyehi satta rattindivānipahaṃ bhagavato
etamatthaṃ vyākareyyaṃ aññamaññehi padehi aññamaññehi pariyāyehī
ti._
____

This ability to talk for seven days on a topic he had never before considered,
we call 'intuitive knowledge.' The Buddha said Sāriputta was able to answer
like this because he had correctly penetrated "that aspect of the teaching"
(_sā dhammadhātu suppaṭividdhā_) that made such an ability possible.

[quote, S.2.56]
____
That aspect of the teaching has been correctly penetrated by Sāriputta, which
through being correctly penetrated... if I had for seven days and nights
questioned Sāriputta about the matter in various ways and manners, then for
seven days and nights Sāriputta would have been able to answer me in various
ways and manners.

_Sā hi bhikkhu sāriputtassa dhammadhātu suppaṭividdhā yassa

===== Instruction on the Log: the nature of the elements

Venerable Sāriputta pointed to a large wooden log and said:

[quote, A.3.340-1]
____
'A bhikkhu with psychic power and mental mastery could, if he wished, focus on
the solidness (_paṭhavī_) of that wooden log. How is that? There is the
Solidness Phenomenon (_paṭhavīdhātu_) in that log of wood, by reason of
which a bhikkhu with psychic power and mental mastery could focus on its
solidness (_paṭhavī_).'

_Ākaṅkhamāno āvuso bhikkhu iddhimā cetovasippatto amuṃ dārukkhandhaṃ

_ajjhattikā āpodhātu_

Whatever is internal that is liquid or watery, part of an individual, and taken
personally: bile, gastric mucus, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, skin-grease,
spittle, snot, synovial fluid, urine, and whatever else is internal that is
liquid or watery, part of an individual, and taken personally, this is called
the internal Liquidness Phenomenon.

_Yaṃ ajjhattaṃ paccattaṃ āpo āpogataṃ upādinnaṃ seyyathidaṃ

Namely, that by which one is heated, that by which one is hurt, that by which
one is burnt, that by which what is eaten, drunk, chewed and savored gets
digested, and whatever else is internal that is warm or hot, part of an
individual, and taken personally, this is called the internal Warmth Phenomenon.

_yena ca santappati yena ca jīrīyati yena ca pariḍayhati yena ca

____

===== Definition: Gaseousness Phenomenon

[quote, M.1.188]
____
What is the internal Gaseousness Phenomenon?

_ayaṃ vuccatāvuso ajjhattikā vāyodhātu._
____

===== Similes: the butchered cow

The contemplation of the four great material phenomena is described like this:

[quote, M.1.57]
____
The bhikkhu contemplates this very body however placed or disposed in terms of
material phenomena.

_imameva kāyaṃ yathāṭhitaṃ yathāpaṇihitaṃ dhātuso paccavekkhati_

(...) In this [wretched human] body there is the Solidness Phenomenon, the
Liquidness Phenomenon, the Warmth Phenomenon, and the Gaseousness Phenomenon.

_Atthi imasmiṃ kāye paṭhavīdhātu āpodhātu tejodhātu vāyodhātū ti_

(...) Just as a butcher or his apprentice having killed a cow and cut it into
pieces were seated with it at a crossroads, the bhikkhu contemplates this very
body however placed or disposed in terms of material phenomena.
____

The butchered cow simile suggests that one who meditates on the four great
material phenomena will see just material qualities, and will realise that, in
that respect, living bodies are indistinguishable from dead ones.

===== Kasiṇas

The four great material phenomena are subjects of kasiṇa practices, as
follows:

[quote, D.3.268]
____
One individual perceives the kasiṇa of earth extending above, below, and
across from himself, with no subject/object duality and without limitation

_paṭhavīkasiṇameko sañjānāti uddhaṃ adho tiriyaṃ advayaṃ
appamāṇaṃ._

The other kasiṇas are: water, fire, wind, blue, yellow, red, white, space,
and advertence

_āpokasiṇa tejokasiṇa vāyokasiṇa nīlakasiṇa pītakasiṇa
lohitakasiṇa odātakasiṇa ākāsakasiṇa viññāṇakasiṇa_
____

The kasiṇas apparently involve imagining the Elements in their concrete sense
extending in all directions.

_nahārudaddulaṃ vā aggimhi pakkhīttaṃ patilīyati patikuṭati

===== Patilīna: withdrawn from society

_Patilīna_, the past participle of _patilīyati_, can mean 'withdrawn from
society:

[quote, Sn.v.810]
____
For a bhikkhu living withdrawn from society, resorting to a secluded abode,
they say it is fitting for him to not exhibit his ego in any residence.

=== Pattipatta

==== Renderings

- _pattipatta_: attained the [supreme] attainment

- _paramapattipatta_: attained the supreme attainment

- _uttamapattipatta_: attained the unexcelled attainment

==== Introduction

===== Pattipatta and uttamapattipatta

_Pattipatta_ is found only in verse and implies arahantship. It is an
abbreviation of either:

1. _uttamapattipatta_, 'attained the unexcelled attainment,' which occurs only
in the _Samaṇamaṇḍikā Sutta_ (M.2.23-29), or,

2. _paramapattipatta_, 'attained the supreme attainment,' which occurs only in
the _Saṃyutta Nikāya_.

===== Paramapattipatta: orthodox

_Paramapattipatta_ is likely more orthodox than _uttamapattipatta_.
_Uttamapattipatta_ is apparently used in the _Samaṇamaṇḍikā Sutta_ to
avoid a repetition of _parama_ in this word sequence:

- _sampannakusalaṃ paramakusalaṃ uttamapattipattaṃ_

Therefore, we regard _pattipatta_ as an abbreviation of _paramapattipatta_
('attained the supreme attainment').

Likewise, Norman treats _pattipatta_ as an abbreviation: 'gained the [highest]
gain' (e.g. Sn.v.536-7).

=== Padussati

==== Renderings

- _padussati_: to pollute (the sea)

- _padussati_: to defile (the mind)

- _padussati_: to be filled with hatred

==== Introduction

===== Padussati: two roots

_Padussati_ has two roots, so two possible meanings: to defile, and to be
filled with hatred. Although this division is visible in the suttas (see our
Illustrations below), PED has overlooked this, saying:

- _Padussati_ [_pa+dussati_] to do wrong, offend against, make bad, corrupt

This is in spite of PED's recognising the two roots of _padosa_:

1. _Padosa1_ [pa+dosa1, Sk. pradoṣa] defect, fault, blemish, badness,
corruption, sin

2. _Padosa2_ [pa+dosa2, Sk. pradveṣa, see remarks to dosa2] anger, hatred,
ill--will; always as mano° "anger in mind" M I.377.

===== Translating appaduṭṭhassa

One result of this in the translation of _appaduṭṭhassa_ in Dh.v.125, which
has been called 'innocent,' 'harmless,' or 'inoffensive':

- Whoever does harm to an innocent man, a pure man who is without blemish, evil
comes back to that very fool like fine dust thrown against the wind (Norman,
Dh.v.125).

- Whoever harms a harmless person, one pure and guiltless (Narada, Dh.v.125).

Our own findings show that _padussati_ means unpolluted, undefiled, or free of
hatred, but not innocent or harmless.

____
Whoever wrongs a man who is free of hatred, a pure person unblemished [by
spiritual defilement], the demerit rebounds on the fool himself like fine dust
thrown against the wind (Varado, Dh.v.125).

_Yo appaduṭṭhassa narassa dussati suddhassa posassa anaṅgaṇassa +
Tameva bālaṃ pacceti pāpaṃ sukhumo rajo paṭivātaṃ va khitto_
____

And the internal evidence supports us, because _appaduṭṭhassa_ is here a
synonym of _suddhassa_ and _anaṅgaṇassa_. Our translation recognises the
synonymity (free of hatred, pure, unblemished [by spiritual defilement]), but
Norman's does not (innocent, pure, without blemish). Whereas our adjectives
describe spiritual qualities, innocent concerns conduct, the opposite of
'whoever who does harm.'

- _parājita_: defeated

- _aparājita_: undefeated [by Māra's army]

- _aparājita_: invincible

- _aparājita_: the Invincible One

==== Introduction

===== Parajita: 'defeated'

_Parajita_ usually means 'defeated':

[quote, Sn.v.681]
____
Victory was for the devas, and the asuras were defeated

_jayo surānaṃ asurā parājitā._
____

===== Padhāna Sutta: parenthesising '[by Māra's army]'

In his battle with Māra, the Bodhisatta said:

[quote, Sn.v.440]
____
'Death in battle is better for me than to [surrender and] live on defeated.'

_Saṅgāme me mataṃ seyyo yaṃ ce jīve parājito._
____

By 'defeated' he meant 'defeated [by Māra's army]' because, in the previous
verse, concerning the ten armies of Māra, he said:

[quote, Sn.v.439]
____
'That is your army, Namuci, the forces of inward darkness. None but the heroic
will conquer it. Having conquered it one finds happiness.'

_Esā namuci te senā kaṇhassābhippahārinī +
Na naṃ asūro jināti jetvā ca labhate sukhaṃ._
____

Where 'defeated' needs parenthesising, this, then, is our parenthesis. It is
supported by other passages:

[quote, Th.v.1095]
____
When will I, having furiously taken up the seers' sword of wisdom of fierce
strength, [sitting cross-legged] on the invincible seat, quickly destroy Māra

Māraṃ sasenaṃ sahasā bhañjissaṃ sīhāsane taṃ nu kadā bhavissati_
____

Commentary: _Sīhāsaneti thirāsane aparājitapallaṅketi attho_.

===== Commentary: kilesa and Māra

Frequently the commentary explains _parājito_ in terms of Māra, as we show in
quotes in the illustrations below. Sometimes it explains _parājito_ in terms
of _kilesa_. For example, _kilesehi parājito_ (Th.v.194). However, _kilesa_ is
a synonym of Māra's army and there seems no advantage in changing the
parenthesis when the suttas are already clear which parenthesis is to be
applied. _Parājito_ implies war, which fits well with 'army.'

===== Aparājita: the Invincible One

In the context of the Buddha, we call _aparājita_ 'the Invincible One':

[quote, Th.v.131-2]

Since [the time] I heard the Teacher's teaching spoken, I do not recall [in
myself any] unsureness about the [perfection of the transcendent insight of

=== Pariciṇṇo mayā satthā

==== Renderings

- _Pariciṇṇo mayā satthā_: the Teacher has been [lovingly] venerated by
me [through my practice in accordance with the teaching]

==== Introduction

===== Gratitude plus arahantship

_Pariciṇṇo mayā satthā_ is an expression of gratitude to the Buddha that
simultaneously indicates the attainment of arahantship. For example, it was
used in this way by Venerable Vacchagotta (M.1.497), and also by ten bhikkhus
in the _Theragāthā_. See Illustrations.

===== Origin: veneration of fires

_Pariciṇṇo_ may have stemmed from its application to the veneration of
sacrificial fires. For example, the Buddha said:

[quote, M.1.82]
____
'It would not be easy to find a kind of fire that has not been venerated by me
(_apariciṇṇapubbo_) in this long time':

_Na kho paneso sāriputta aggi sulabharūpo yo mayā apariciṇṇapubbo iminā
dīghena addhunā._
____

Venerating fires and people is intimately linked through words like
_namassati_, _paricarati,_ and _pūjeti_:

[quote, Dh.v.392]
____
From whoever one might learn the teaching explained by the Perfectly
Enlightened One, one should respectfully venerate him like a brahman venerates
the sacrificial fire.

_Yamhā dhammaṃ vijāneyya sammāsambuddhadesitaṃ +
Sakkaccaṃ taṃ namasseyya aggihuttaṃ va brāhmaṇo._
____

[quote, Dh.v.107]
____
If a person venerated fire in the forest for a century, but then venerated even
for a moment someone who had spiritually developed himself, that veneration
would be certainly better than that [fire] veneration for a century.

_Yo ca vassasataṃ jantu aggiṃ paricare vane +
Ekañca bhāvitattānaṃ muhuttamapi pūjaye +
Sā yeva pūjanā seyyo yañce vassasataṃ hutaṃ._
____

===== Venerating the sacrificial fire

The ceremony of venerating the sacrificial fire has three aspects:

1. It begins with pouring foodstuffs into the fire (_aggiṃ juhati_), for
example, milk rice (S.1.166) or milk (A.2.207) or ghee, oil and butter
(A.5.234), though sometimes animals (A.4.41; D.1.141).

2. Then follows the veneration of the sacrificial fire (_aggihuttaṃ
paricarati_). This is done by venerating the fire with joined palms, and
solemnly addressing it:
+
[quote, A.5.234]
____
'We lower ourselves before thee, Lord. We lower ourselves before thee, Lord.'

_paccorohāma bhavantaṃ paccorohāma bhavantan ti._
____

3. Then comes the distribution of the remains of the oblation (_havyasesaṃ_
Sn.p.79) to any available ascetics or Brahmanists.
+
For example:
+
[quote, S.1.166]
____
At one time milk rice with ghee had been set out for the brahman Aggika
Bhāradvāja, who had thought 'I will offer them to the fire. I will venerate
the sacrificial fire.'

_Tena kho pana samayena aggikabhāradvājassa brāhmaṇassa sappinā pāyāso
sannihito hoti aggiṃ juhissāmi. Aggihuttaṃ paricarissāmī ti._

At that time the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja was making offerings to fire
and venerating the sacrificial fire on the bank of the River Sundarikā. Having
done so, and having risen from his seat, he looked around in the four
directions to see who might eat the remains of the oblation.

_Tena kho pana samayena sundarikabhāradvājo brāhmaṇo sundarikāya nadiyā
tīre aggiṃ juhati aggihuttaṃ paricarati atha kho sundarikabhāradvājo
brāhmaṇo aggiṃ juhitvā aggihuttaṃ paricaritvā uṭṭhāyāsanā
amannā catuddisā anuvilokesi ko nu kho imaṃ havyasesaṃ bhuñjeyyāti._
____

===== Two meanings of paricarati

_Pariciṇṇo_ is the past particle of _paricarati_, and therefore its meaning
would stem from one of the two meanings of _paricarati_ which can be explained
as follows:

1. A matted-hair ascetic told a boy to look after the fire, not let it go out
(_aggiṃ tāta paricareyyāsi. Mā ca te aggi nibbāyi_ D.2.340). Here
_paricarati_ does not mean veneration, but just keeping the fire going.

2. More usually in the scriptures, _paricarati_ is a ceremonial activity that
means venerating, and occurs in the phrase _aggihuttaṃ paricarati_.
_Aggihuttaṃ_ means 'sacrificial fire.' _Huttaṃ_ is the past participle of
_juhati_.

===== Pariciṇṇo: therefore two possible meanings

_Pariciṇṇo_ could therefore mean either the Teacher has been 'looked after
by me' or 'venerated by me.' The latter is obviously more likely. The Buddha
said to look after him one should look after the sick (_yo bhikkhave maṃ
upaṭṭhaheyya so gilānaṃ upaṭṭhaheyya,_ Vin.1.302) -- which is not
the issue here.

===== To venerate the Perfect One: meaning

So, what does it mean to venerate the Perfect One? The Buddha said:

[quote, D.2.138]
____
Those who practise in accordance with the teaching, applying themselves
properly, and conducting themselves in accordance with the teaching, honour,
revere, respect, reverence, and venerate the Perfect One with the highest
veneration.

_yo kho ānanda bhikkhu vā bhikkhunī vā upāsako vā upāsikā vā
dhammānudhammapaṭipanno viharati sāmīcipaṭipanno anudhammacārī so
tathāgataṃ sakkaroti garukaroti māneti pūjeti apaciyati paramāya
pūjāya._
____

Therefore _pariciṇṇo mayā satthā_ means 'the Teacher has been [lovingly]
venerated by me [through my practice in accordance with the teaching].' For
this reason _pariciṇṇo mayā satthā_ not only expresses gratitude to the
Buddha, but simultaneously indicates the attainment of arahantship.

===== Lovingly

The _Ukkhittāsika Sutta_ says that venerating the Buddha is done with
_mettā_. It explains the six advantages of practising according to the
teaching, the last of which is:

[quote, A.3.443]
____
The Teacher will be lovingly venerated by me through my practice [in accordance
with the teaching]

_Satthā ca me pariciṇṇo bhavissati mettāvatāyā tī._
____

This is the source of our parenthesis.

===== Channovāda Sutta

Venerable Channa said that for a long time he had 'venerated the Teacher
_manāpeneva no amanāpena_, [through his practice in accordance with the
teaching], as was fitting for a disciple to do': _Api cāvuso sāriputta
pariciṇṇo me satthā dīgharattaṃ manāpeneva no amanāpena. Etaṃ hi
āvuso sāriputta sāvakassa patirūpaṃ yaṃ satthāraṃ paricareyya
manāpeneva no amanāpena_ (M.3.264).

Let us consider how to translate this. Firstly, _manāpa_ and _amanāpa_ can
mean pleasing and displeasing:

[quote, S.4.172]
____
The eye is attacked by pleasing and displeasing sights.

_Cakkhu bhikkhave haññati manāpāmanāpesu rūpesu._
____

Venerable Channa would then be saying 'the Teacher has been [lovingly]
venerated by me [through my practice in accordance with the teaching] which has
been pleasing, not displeasing,' which does not fit.

Alternatively _manāpa_ and _amanāpa_ are synonyms of _piya_ and _appiya_,
meaning dear and loathsome:

[quote, "A.5.150, D.3.263"]
____
He has harmed, is harming, or will harm someone beloved and dear to me.

_Piyassa me manāpassa anatthaṃ acarīti... caratīti... carissatīti_

He has benefited, is benefiting, or will benefit someone who is unbeloved or
loathsome to me.

_Appiyassa me amanāpassa atthaṃ acari... carati... carissatī ti._
____

In this case, Channa would be saying that his practice had been dear, not
loathsome. This again is inapt, but supports us saying 'lovingly, not
unlovingly,' which is likewise Bodhi's solution: 'with love, not without love.'

[quote, M.3.264]
____
But Sāriputta, friend, the Teacher has been lovingly venerated by me [through
my practice in accordance with the teaching], not unlovingly, as was fitting
for a disciple to do.

_Api cāvuso sāriputta pariciṇṇo me satthā dīgharattaṃ manāpeneva no
amanāpena. Etaṃ hi āvuso sāriputta sāvakassa patirūpaṃ yaṃ
satthāraṃ paricareyya manāpeneva no amanāpena._

=== Paribbajati

==== Renderings

- _paribbajati_: to fulfil the ideals of religious asceticism

- _paribbājaka_: philosophiser ascetic

- _paribbājaka (=aññatitthiyā paribbājakā)_: non-Buddhist ascetic; ascetic

- _paribbājaka_: one who has fulfilled the ideals of religious asceticism

==== Introduction

===== Paribbajati: an exalted practice

_Paribbajati_ is one of the poetical words of Buddhism, and found only in
verse. It is usually (and misleadingly) rendered as 'wander.' In fact it is an
exalted practice that even implies arahantship.

===== Paribbajati means asceticism

_Paribbajati_ is the subject of the _Sammāparibbājanīya Sutta_, which is the
Buddha's answer to the following question:

[quote, Sn.v.359]
____
Having renounced the household life [and] thrust away sensuous pleasure, how
would a bhikkhu properly fulfil the ideals of religious asceticism in the world?

_Nikkhamma gharā panujja kāme kathaṃ bhikkhu sammā so loke paribbajeyya._
____

That _paribbajeyya_ implies asceticism is obvious in the question, involving
the renunciation of the household life, and the thrusting away of sensuous
pleasure.

===== Paribbajati means arahantship

That _paribbajati_ ultimately implies arahantship is clear in this portion of
the Buddha's answer:

[quote, Sn.v.374]
____
One who has destroyed all states of attachment, having realised the
[Untroubled] State, having understood the teaching, having clearly seen the
abandonment of all perceptually obscuring states: he would properly fulfil the
ideals of religious asceticism in the world.

_Aññāya padaṃ samecca dhammaṃ vivaṭaṃ disvāna pahānamāsavānaṃ +
Sabbūpadhinaṃ parikkhayāno sammā so loke paribbajeyya._
____

_Sabbupadhīnaṃ parikkhayāno_: 'One who has destroyed all states of
attachment.' Norman treats this as an instrumental: 'because of the destruction
of all acquisitions.' We regard it as a primary derivative and a noun with a
kita suffix. See Duroiselle para 563-578.

===== Paribbajati does not mean 'wander'

Calling _paribbajati_ 'wander' has had nonsensical results. For example, Norman
says that Th.v.1162 means 'a bhikkhu should wander about as though smitten by a
sword.' This rendering has also led to the view that the bhikkhu's life is for
wandering. But the bhikkhu's life, even for arahants, may involve no wandering
at all. For example, if a bhikkhu is living in some quiet grove and his
spiritual development is satisfactory, then:

[quote, M.1.106]
____
'that bhikkhu should continue living in that quiet grove for the rest of his
life; he should not depart'

_Tena bhikkhave bhikkhunā yāvajīvampi tasmiṃ vanapatthe vatthabbaṃ na
pakkamitabbaṃ._
____

===== Paribbajati versus cārika

The usual words for 'wandering' are _carati_ and _cārika._ Although the
scriptures say there are benefits in periodic wandering (_ānisaṃsā
samavatthacāre_ A.3.257), there are dangers (_ādīnavā_) if it goes on too
long (_dīghacārikaṃ_ A.3.257). Therefore is often criticised:

[quote, A.3.257]
____
Bhikkhus, there are these five disadvantages for one who engages in lengthy and
unsettled wandering. What five?

_Pañcime bhikkhave ādīnavā dīghacārikaṃ anavattha cārikaṃ
anuyuttassa viharato. Katame pañca._
____

[quote, Sn.v.925]
____
He should be meditative, not wandering about.

_Jhāyī na pādalolassa._
____

[quote, Th.v.37]
____
They go to different countries, wandering unrestrained. If they lose their
inward collectedness, what good will this international travelling do?
Therefore one should eliminate [such] harmful conduct. One should meditate
unaccompanied.

_Nānājanapadaṃ yanti vicarantā asaṃyatā +
Samādhiñca virādhenti kiṃsu raṭṭhacariyā karissati +
Tasmā vineyya sārambhaṃ jhāyeyya apurakkhato ti._
____

By comparison, if _paribbajati_ meant wandering, we would expect an excess of
it to be likewise regarded with caution. Instead, however, it is associated
solely with what is good. Indeed, one should do it to the maximum possible
extent, as if threatened with a sword, or as if one's head were on fire (see
illustrations below, S.1.53).

===== Paribbājaka: two meanings

The term _paribbājaka_ is derived from _paribbajati_, and so for etmological
reasons is usually (and misleadingly) rendered 'wanderer.' In fact
_paribbājaka_ has two meanings:

1. non-Buddhist ascetics

2. a group of non-Buddhist ascetics renowned for their talkativeness, which we
call 'philosophiser ascetics.'

===== Paribbājaka: non-Buddhist ascetics

____
Paribbājaka can mean 'non-Buddhist ascetics.' For example, Pācittiya 41 says
it is an offence for a bhikkhu to give food with his hand to a naked ascetic
(_acelaka_), or to a non-Buddhist ascetic (_paribbājako_), or to a female
non-Buddhist ascetic (_paribbājikā_).

_Yo pana bhikkhu acelakassa vā paribbājakassa vā paribbājikāya vā
sahattā khādanīyaṃ vā bhojanīyaṃ vā dadeyya pācittiyan ti._
____

The definition of these terms confirms that 'non-Buddhist' is meant:

[quote, Vin.4.92]
____
Naked ascetic (_acelako_) means: whoever being naked is a non-Buddhist ascetic
(_paribbājaka_).

_Acelako nāma yo koci paribbājaka samāpanno naggo_

Non-Buddhist ascetic (_paribbājako_) means: setting aside bhikkhu and
sāmaṇera, whoever is an ascetic (_paribbājaka_).

_Paribbājako nāma bhikkhuñca sāmaṇerañca ṭhapetvā yo koci
paribbājaka samāpanno_

Female non-Buddhist ascetic (_paribbājikā_) means: setting aside bhikkhunī
and sikkhamānā and sāmaṇerī, whoever is a female ascetic.

_Paribbājikā nāma bhikkhuniñca sikkhamānañca sāmaṇeriñca ṭhapetvā
yā kāci paribbājikasamāpannā._
____

===== Aññatitthiyā paribbājakā: non-Buddhist ascetics

_Paribbājakā_ is an abbreviation for _aññatitthiyā paribbājakā_, which
therefore also means 'non-Buddhist ascetic.' But sometimes _aññatitthiyā
paribbājakā_ is called 'ascetic of another sect,' as if the Buddha's group is
also a sect. 'Sect' means:

- A subdivision of a larger religious group

- A dissenting clique (WordWeb).

Neither Buddhists nor non-Buddhist ascetics were subdivisions of a larger
group. They were altogether separate groups of ascetics.

===== Paribbājaka: philosophiser ascetics

_Paribbājaka_ is also the name of a certain group of non-Buddhist ascetics
whose lifestyle was governed by the idea that wisdom comes from conversation
(D.3.38). We will call them 'philosophiser ascetics.' Calling them 'philosopher
ascetics' would unjustly magnify them and their usually frivolous topics of
conversation, for example about battles, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands,
scents, relations etc. (D.3.36).

Philosophiser ascetics said that the Buddha's wisdom was destroyed by the
solitary life (_suññāgārahatā samaṇassa gotamassa paññā_) and that he
was no good at conversation. Apart from the practice of companionship, they
praised the practice of self-mortification (D.3.40-1). Their goal was to
realise an exclusively pleasant world, and some of them practised samādhi, but
only up to third jhāna (M.2.37).

These _paribbājakas_ are correctly known as ascetics, because their lifestyle
involved not just the five precepts, but also celibacy (_brahmacārī_,
A.3.276). It also involved a simple lifestyle, eating just once a day, and not
after noon (_rattūparato ekabhattiko_ M.2.89).

Of the two types of _paribbājaka_ neither are linked in the scriptures to
wandering, so that label is simply inappropriate.

===== Paribbājaka: arahant

Thirdly, _paribbājaka_ is a term for an arahant, and in which case we render
the word as 'one who has fulfilled the ideals of religious asceticism.' See the
last of the Illustrations below (Sn.v.537).

===== Parimukhaṃ: objective

Here we will explain here our translation of _parimukhaṃ satiṃ
upaṭṭhapetvā_, as it occurs in this phrase:

[quote, M.2.139]
____
He seats himself. Having crossed his legs, having set his body erect, having
established mindfulness within himself,

_nisīdati pallaṅkaṃ ābhujitvā ujuṃ kāyaṃ paṇidhāya parimukhaṃ

____

===== Parimukhaṃ: 'round the mouth'

_Parimukhaṃ_ can mean 'round the mouth' and is therefore used for
'moustache'_:_

[quote, Vin.2.134]
____
The hair round the mouth should not be coiffed.

_na parimukhaṃ kārāpetabbaṃ._
____

===== Mindfulness around the mouth

But does this necessarily mean that meditators should establish mindfulness
around their mouths? Because this would only be remotely appropriate where the
meditation is on breathing. In fact _parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā_
occurs in other meditations, too. For example, as a prelude to meditation on
[unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill:

[quote, A.1.183]
____
I seat myself cross-legged, setting my body erect, establishing mindfulness
within myself. Then I abide pervading one quarter with a mind of [unlimited,

Most translators agree that _parimukhaṃ_ is an adverb of place, and commonly
render our phrase 'he establishes mindfulness in front of him.' In the _Udāna_
and _Itivuttaka_, _parimukhaṃ_ occurs together with another adverb of place,
_ajjhattaṃ_:

[quote, Ud.77-8]
____
The Blessed One saw Venerable Mahākaccāna sitting nearby, seated
cross-legged, with his body upright, with mindfulness of the body
well-established internally within himself (_ajjhattaṃ parimukhaṃ_).

_Addasā kho bhagavā āyasmantaṃ mahākaccānaṃ avidūre nisinnaṃ
pallaṅkaṃ ābhujitvā ujuṃ kāyaṃ paṇidhāya kāyagatāya satiyā
ajjhattaṃ parimukhaṃ supaṭṭhitāya._
____

[quote, It.80]
____
When mindfulness with breathing is well-established internally within yourself
(_ajjhattaṃ parimukhaṃ_), the proclivity to extraneous thoughts that are
vexatious does not exist.

_Ānāpānasatiyā ajjhattaṃ parimukhaṃ sūpaṭṭhitāya ye bāhirā
vitakkāsayā vighātapakkhikā te na honti._
____

There are three reasons why _parimukhaṃ_ must mean 'within himself':

1. The stringing together of synonyms is a common feature of Pāli. If this is
also the case here, then _parimukhaṃ_ is simply a synonym of _ajjhattaṃ_,
meaning 'within himself.'

2. If _parimukhaṃ_ is an adverb of place, then it must inevitably be a
synonym of _ajjhattaṃ_, because otherwise it leads to this contradiction:

- His body upright, with mindfulness of the body well-established internally in
front of himself (Ud.77-8).

- When mindfulness with breathing is well-established internally in front of
yourself (It.80).

3. In the construction of similar expressions in other contexts, mindfulness is
shown to be established in a locative sense in relation to the meditator:

[quote, S.5.331]
____
Whenever, Ānanda, a bhikkhu abides contemplating the nature of the body, on
that occasion unmuddled mindfulness is established within him (_tassa_).

_Yasmiṃ samaye ānanda bhikkhu kāye kāyānupassī viharati upaṭṭhitā
tassa tasmiṃ samaye sati hoti asammuṭṭhā._

(...) Whenever, Ānanda, unmuddled mindfulness is established in a bhikkhu
(_bhikkhuno_), on that occasion the enlightenment factor of mindfulness is
aroused in the bhikkhu (_bhikkhuno_).

_Yasmiṃ samaye ānanda bhikkhuno upaṭṭhitā sati hoti asammuṭṭhā
satisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṃ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti._
____

===== Genitives rendered as locatives

We will now digress to justify our rendering of genitives _tassa_ and
_bhikkhuno_ as locatives, and hence show that according to the passage just
quoted, that mindfulness is established in a locative sense, namely 'within
oneself.' Our justification is that both Bodhi and Horner also render them as
locatives in a similar passage at M.3.85:

[quote, M.3.85]
____
Bodhi: On whatever occasion unremitting mindfulness is established in a
bhikkhu—on that occasion the mindfulness enlightenment factor is aroused in
him.

Horner: At the time, monks, when unmuddled mindfulness is aroused in the
monk, at that time the link in awakening that is mindfulness is stirred up in
the monk.

_Yasmiṃ samaye bhikkhave bhikkhuno upaṭṭhitā sati hoti
asammuṭṭhā satisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṃ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti_
____

In conclusion, _parimukhaṃ_ has a locative sense and is a synonym of
_ajjhattaṃ_. Therefore mindfulness is established within oneself, not in
front of oneself.

===== Expansion of meditation: parimukhaṃ the first step

We have seen that _parimukhaṃ_ means that mindfulness is established within
oneself because it is a synonym of _ajjhattaṃ_. Following this, we can now
see that _parimukhaṃ_ is the first of several steps, because meditations that
begin with oneself are repeatedly said to be expanded outwards:

[quote, D.2.216]
____
As he abides contemplating the nature of the body internally he becomes
perfectly inwardly collected and perfectly serene. Being thus perfectly
inwardly collected and perfectly serene he arouses knowledge and vision
externally of others' bodies [according to reality].

_Ajjhattaṃ kāye kāyānupassī viharanto tattha sammāsamādhiyati
sammāvippasīdati. So tattha sammā samāhito sammāvippasanno bahiddhā
parakāye ñāṇadassanaṃ abhinibbatteti._
____

[quote, S.5.143]
____
You should develop the [contemplation of the] four bases of mindfulness in a
threefold way. Which four?

_cattāro satipaṭṭhāne tividhena bhaveyyāsi. Katame cattāro. Idha tvaṃ
bhikkhu_

In this regard, bhikkhu, abide contemplating the nature of the body internally

_idha tvaṃ bhikkhu ajjhattaṃ kāye kāyānupassī viharāhi_

abide contemplating the nature of the body externally

_bahiddhā kāye kāyānupassī viharāhi_

abide contemplating the nature of the body internally and externally

_ajjhattabahiddhā kāye kāyānupassī viharāhi._
____

[quote, M.2.139]
____
Having washed his feet he seats himself. Having crossed his legs, having set
his body erect, having established mindfulness within himself,

_So pāde pakkhāletvā nisīdati pallaṅkaṃ ābhujitvā ujuṃ kāyaṃ
paṇidhāya parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā._

(...) He sits reflecting on his own welfare, on the welfare of others and on
the welfare of both, indeed on the welfare of the whole world.

_Attahitaṃ parahitaṃ ubhayahitaṃ sabbalokahitameva so bhavaṃ gotamo
cintento nisinno hoti._
____

===== Connecting the absolutives

Ānandajoti says:

- 'The absolutives here and in the next line are connected with the finite
verbs _assasati_ and _passasati_, and not with _nisīdati_ in the preceding
line, in which case the folding of the legs, setting the body straight, and
establishment of mindfulness would all occur before he sat down!'

We render _pallaṅkaṃ ābhujitvā_ as 'having crossed his legs,' ('having
bent in the round lap,' says PED, sv _Ābhujati_), and thus the sentence as
follows:

[quote, M.1.56]
____
He seats himself. Having crossed his legs, having set his body erect, having
established mindfulness within himself, mindfully he breathes in; mindfully he
breathes out.

_nisīdati pallaṅkaṃ ābhujitvā ujuṃ kāyaṃ paṇidhāya parimukhaṃ
satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā. So satova assasati sato passasati._

sub-human existence, bound for hell, and he will remain there for the period of

What is the systematic exposition of the teaching that involves a comparison
with oneself?

_Katamo ca gahapatayo attūpanāyiko dhammapariyāyo:_

In this regard, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: 'I am one who
wishes to live, who does not wish to die; I desire happiness and loathe pain.
Since I am one who wishes to live... and loathe pain, if someone were to take
my life, that would not be agreeable and pleasing to me.

_idha gahapatayo ariyasāvako iti paṭisañcikkhati ahaṃ khosmi jīvitukāmo
amaritukāmo sukhakāmo dukkhapaṭikkūlo. Yo kho maṃ jīvitukāmaṃ
amaritukāmaṃ sukhakāmaṃ dukkhapaṭikkūlaṃ jīvitā voropeyya na me
taṃ assa piyaṃ manāpaṃ_

Now if I were to take the life of another -- of one who wishes to live, who
does not wish to die, who desires happiness and loathes pain -- that would not
be agreeable and pleasing to the other either. What is disagreeable and
displeasing to me is disagreeable and displeasing to the other too. How can I
inflict upon another what is disagreeable and displeasing to me?'

_ahañceva kho pana paraṃ jīvitukāmaṃ. Sukhakāmaṃ
dukkhapaṭikkūlaṃ jīvitā voropeyya parassapi taṃ assa appiyaṃ

amanāpo. Yo kho myāyaṃ dhammo appiyo amanāpo kathāhaṃ paraṃ tena

In reflecting thus, he himself abstains from killing, exhorts others to abstain
from killing, and speaks in praise of abstaining from killing.

And what is the systematic exposition of the teaching on the theme of 'The one

_Katamo ca bhikkhave yogakkhemipariyāyo dhammapariyāyo?_

There are visible objects known via the visual sense that are likeable,
loveable, pleasing, agreeable, connected with sensuous pleasure, and charming.
These have been abandoned by the Perfect One, chopped down at the root,
completely and irreversibly destroyed, never to arise again in future.

And what is the systematic exposition of the teaching on the theme of burning?_

_Katamo ca bhikkhave ādittāpariyāyo dhammapariyāyo?_

It would be better for the faculty of sight to be blotted out by a red-hot iron
pin, burning, blazing, and glowing, than for one to grasp the features or
aspects of a visible object known via the visual sense. For if one's stream of
sense consciousness should stand tied to the sweetness of the features or
aspects of the object, and if one should die on that occasion, it is possible
that one will go to one of two places of rebirth: hell or the animal realm.
Seeing this danger, I speak thus.

=== Pariḷāha

==== Renderings

- _pariḷāha_: passion

- _pariḷāha_: anguish

- _pariḷāha_: [sensuous] passion

==== Introduction

===== Passion and anguish: associated with burning

_Pariḷāha_ means passion or anguish. Both are associated with torment:

[quote, M.1.508]
____
tormented by sensuous passion

_kāmapariḷāhena pariḍayhamānā._
____

[quote, S.5.451]
____
they are tormented by the anguish of birth

_jātipariḷāhena pi pariḍayhanti._
____

===== Anguish stems from rāga, dosa, and moha

[quote, A.1.137]
____
Being tormented by the anguish born of attachment he would sleep badly

_rāgajehi pariḷāhehi pariḍayhamāno dukkhaṃ sayeyyāti_

Being tormented by the anguish born of hatred he would sleep badly

_dosajehi pariḷāhehi pariḍayhamāno dukkhaṃ sayeyyāti_

Being tormented by the anguish born of undiscernment of reality he would sleep
badly

_mohajehi pariḷāhehi pariḍayhamāno dukkhaṃ sayeyyāti._
____

===== Bad passions

Bad passions are:

[quote, S.2.151-3]
____
sensuous passion

_kāmapariḷāho_

unbenevolent passion

_vyāpādapariḷāho_

malicious passion

_vihiṃsāpariḷāho_

These lead to sensuous, unbenevolent and malicious quests, engaged in which the
ignorant Everyman conducts himself wrongly by way of body, speech, and mind.

_Kāmapariyesanaṃ... Vyāpādapariyesanaṃ... Vihiṃsāpariyesanaṃ
bhikkhave pariyesamāno assutavā puthujjano tīhi ṭhānehi micchā
paṭipajjati: kāyena vācāya manasā._
____

===== Good passions

Good passions are:

[quote, S.2.151-3]
____
unsensuous passion

_nekkhammapariḷāho_

benevolent passion

_avyāpādapariḷāho_

compassionate passion

_avihiṃsāpariḷāho_

These lead to unsensuous, benevolent and compassionate quests, engaged in which
the learned noble disciple conducts himself rightly by way of body, speech, and
mind.

_Nekkhammapariyesanaṃ... Avyāpādapariyesanaṃ... Avihiṃsāpariyesanaṃ
bhikkhave pariyesamāno sutavā ariyasāvako tīhi ṭhānehi sammā
paṭipajjati: kāyena vācāya manasā._
____

===== Sensuous passion

_Pariḷāha_ usually has an object, for example:

[quote, A.2.10-11]
____
sensuous passion _

_kāmapariḷāho_

passion for individual existence _

_bhavapariḷāho_

passion for views

_diṭṭhipariḷāho._
____

Where it has no object, sensuous passion (_kāmapariḷāha_) is often implied:

[quote, D.3.88]
____
Because they spend an excessive amount of time gazing at each other, lust was
aroused and sensuous passion arose in their bodies. Out of [sensuous] passion
they engaged in sexual intercourse.

_Tesaṃ ativelaṃ aññamaññaṃ upanijjhāyataṃ sārāgo udapādi
pariḷāho kāyasmiṃ okkami. Te pariḷāhapaccayā methunaṃ dhammaṃ
paṭiseviṃsu._
____

This helps interpret Thī.v.33-34, where we take _pariḷāho_ as 'sensuous
passion,' as follows:

===== Interpreting Thī.v.33-34

[quote, Thī.v.33-4]
____
From the soles of the feet up, mother, and down from the hair on the crown of
the head, contemplate this foul, malodorous body

_Uddhaṃ pādatalā amma adho ve kesamatthakā +
Paccavekkhassu'maṃ kāyaṃ asuciṃ pūtigandhikaṃ_

(...) As I abide in this way, all my attachment is abolished. My [sensuous]
passion is annihilated. I am freed from inward distress. I have realised the
Untroubled._

_Evaṃ viharamānāya sabbo rāgo samūhato +
Pariḷāho samucchinno sītibhūtāmhi nibbutā ti._
____

Rendering _pariḷāha_ as 'sensuous passion' is supported by the fact that
reflecting on the parts of body is associated with 'the abandonment of
attachment to sensuous pleasure' (_Idaṃ bhante anussatiṭṭhānaṃ evaṃ
bhāvitaṃ evaṃ bahūlikataṃ kāmarāgassa pahānāya saṃvattati,_
A.3.323).

=== Paviveka

==== Renderings

- _paviveka_: physical seclusion

- _paviveka_: seclusion from (_Paviveka Sutta_ and _Dutiyadasabala Sutta_).

==== Introduction

===== Paviveka: physical seclusion

_Paviveka_ means physical seclusion except in the _Paviveka Sutta_, where the
Buddha indicates that its use is inappropriate.

===== Paviveka: the Paviveka Sutta

In the _Paviveka Sutta_ (A.1.240-1) non-Buddhist ascetics used _paviveka_ to
mean seclusion from luxurious items:

____
Bhikkhus, non-Buddhist ascetics expound three forms of seclusion.

_Tīṇimāni bhikkhave aññatitthiyā paribbājakā pavivekāni paññāpenti_
____

1. robe material
+
****
_cīvarapavivekaṃ_
****

2. almsfood
+
****
_piṇḍapātapavivekaṃ_
****

3. abodes
+
****
_senāsanapavivekaṃ_
****

These forms of seclusion meant:

1. wearing coarse robes, including hair blankets (_kesakambalampi dhārenti_)

2. eating coarse almsfood, including cowdung (_gomayabhakkhā pi honti_)

3. living in the open air (_abbhokāsaṃ_)

But to confirm that _paviveka_ is wrong useage, in his retort the Buddha used
the term _vivitto hoti._ He said:

____
There are three forms of seclusion (_pavivekāni_) for a bhikkhu in this
teaching and training system

_tīṇi kho panimāni bhikkhave imasmiṃ dhammavinaye bhikkhuno pavivekāni_
____

1. He is virtuous. Having abandoned immorality, he is secluded from it
+
****
_sīlavā ca hoti dussīlyañcassa pahīṇaṃ hoti tena ca vivitto hoti_
****

[quote, A.1.240-1]
____
He has right perception [of reality]. Having abandoned wrong view [of reality],
he is secluded from it

_sammādiṭṭhiko hoti micchādiṭṭhi ca'ssa pahīṇā hoti tāya ca
vivitto hoti_

He is free of perceptually obscuring states. Having abandoned them, he is
secluded from them

_khīṇāsavo hoti āsavā ca'ssa pahīṇā honti tehi ca vivitto hoti._
____

The Buddha's use of _vivitto_ proves that _paviveka_ should be corrected to
_viveka_.

===== Dutiyadasabala Sutta: pavivitto exception

In the _Dutiyadasabala Sutta_ (S.2.28-9) _pavivitto_ occurs in the phrase
_pavivitto pāpakehi akusalehi dhammehi_, where one would have expected
_vivitto_. This word combination occurs just once in the suttas, and is
considered a mistake even by the commentary, which says: _Pavivitto ti vivitto
viyutto hutvā_. Usually _akusalehi dhammehi_ is linked with _vivicca_, a word
combination that occurs 185 times, always in this phrase:

[quote, M.1.435]
____
Secluded from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors, he enters
and abides in first jhāna, which is accompanied by thinking and pondering, and
rapture and physical pleasure born of seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and
spiritually unwholesome factors].

_vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ
vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati._
____

The combination with _pavivitto_ is this:

[quote, S.2.28-9]
____
The energetic person abides happily, secluded from unvirtuous, spiritually
unwholesome factors, and great is the personal good that he achieves.

_Āraddhaviriyo ca kho bhikkhave sukhaṃ viharati pavivitto pāpakehi
akusalehi dhammehi mahantañca sadatthaṃ paripūreti._
____

===== Paviveka: in verse 'viveka'

Sometimes in verse, _paviveka_ is shortened to _viveka._ This is illustrated sv
_Viveka_.

===== Paviveka and viveka: inseparably linked

That the Buddha regarded living secludedly (_pavivitta_) to be inseparably
linked to the development of seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually
unwholesome factors] (_viveka_) is clear in these two quotes:

[quote, A.4.233]
____
This teaching is for those who live secludedly, not for those given to the
enjoyment of company. So it was said. And in reference to what was it said?

_Pavivittassāyaṃ bhikkhave dhammo nāyaṃ dhammo saṅgaṇikārāmassā'
ti iti kho panetaṃ vuttaṃ kiñcetaṃ paṭicca vuttaṃ_

(...) In this regard, the bhikkhu living secludedly may be visited by bhikkhus,
bhikkhunīs, laymen, laywomen, kings and kings' ministers, and non-Buddhist
ascetics and their disciples.

_idha bhikkhave bhikkhuno pavivittassa viharato bhavanti upasaṅkamitāro
bhikkhū bhikkhūniyo upāsakā upāsikāyo rājāno rājamahāmattā titthiyā
titthiyasāvakā._

(...) In that case, the bhikkhu, mentally inclining, verging, and drifting
towards seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome
factors], psychologically withdrawn [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually
unwholesome factors], taking delight in the practice of unsensuousness, is one
whose words are exclusively connected with religious inspiration.

_Tatra bhikkhu vivekaninnena cittena vivekapoṇena vivekapabbhārena
vavakaṭṭhena nekkhammābhiratena aññadatthu
uyyojanikapaṭisaṃyuttaṃyeva kathaṃ kattā hoti._
____

The Buddha regarded the training in _viveka_ to be part of the burden of
_paviveka_:

[quote, M.1.14]
____
The disciples of a teacher who lives secludedly do not likewise train
themselves in seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome
factors]. They do not abandon those things which the teacher tells them to
abandon. They are luxurious and careless, leaders in backsliding, throwing off
the burden of physical seclusion.

_Idhāvuso satthu pavivittassa viharato sāvakā vivekaṃ nānusikkhanti.
Yesañca dhammānaṃ satthā pahānamāha te ca dhamme nappajahanti.
Bāhulikā ca honti sāthalikā okkamane pubbaṅgamā paviveke

pleasure of the practice of unsensuousness, the pleasure of physical seclusion,
the pleasure of inward peace, the pleasure of enlightenment.

===== Introduction: word family

The word family considered here is:

- _pasīdati_: believe in, gain faith in, be serene

- _pasāda_: faith, serenity

- _pasādeti_: be serene

- _pasādaniya_: faith inspiring, worthy of faith

- _pasanna_: serene, believe in, faith

===== Introduction: prefixes

These terms are straightforward, but their number of associated prefixes is
daunting. Fortunately the effect of these prefixes (_abhi- vi-_ and _sam-_) is
negligible except in two respects:

1. Whereas _pasīdati_ and _sampasīdati_ mean 'have faith in,'
_abhippasīdati_ means 'have complete faith'

2. The unprefixed word family has a larger range of meaning than the prefixed
words, and so the meanings of prefixed words all fall within the range of
unprefixed words, with one exception: whereas _vippasanna_ can mean limpid,
_pasanna_ cannot.

===== Introduction: objects of faith

The objects of faith are sometimes explicit:

[quote, S.1.160]
____
A brahman lady had complete faith in the Buddha, the teaching, and the
community of the Blessed One's disciples.

_Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhāradvājagottassa brāhmaṇassa
dhanañjānī nāma brāhmaṇī abhippasannā hoti buddhe ca dhamme ca
saṅghe ca._
____

If not, the object can be easily gathered from context:

[quote, Th.v.1276]
____
Hearing your voice, best of seers, I have faith [in you].

_Esa sutvā pasīdāmi vaco te isisattama._
____

===== Faith: technically speaking

_Pasanna_ is a synonym of _saddha,_ as seen in the following quotes:

- _tīhi bhikkhave ṭhānehi saddho pasanno veditabbo_ (A.1.150).

- _so saddho pasanno_ (D.1.212).

Because the object of _saddha_ is 'the perfection of the Perfect One's
transcendent insight,' the same applies to _pasanna_.

[quote, S.5.225]
____
The noble disciple who has complete faith in the [perfection of the] Perfect
One's [transcendent insight] does not have any unsureness or doubt about the
[perfection of the] Perfect One's [transcendent insight], or about the
[significance of the] Perfect One's training system.

_Yo so bhante ariyasāvako tathāgate ekantagato abhippasanno na so tathāgate

Five dangers of having faith which is based on a single individual.

_Pañcime bhikkhave ādīnavā puggalappasāde. Katame pañca:_

When a person's complete faith is based on a single individual (_puggale
puggalo abhippasanno hoti_) and that person falls into an error such that the
community of bhikkhus suspends him, then he will think: 'The community of
bhikkhus has suspended he who is beloved and dear to me.' And he will be no
more full of faith in the bhikkhus (_bhikkhūsu appasādabahulo hoti_), and
from being without faith he will not follow other bhikkhus, and from not
following other bhikkhus he will not hear the true teaching, and from not
hearing the true teaching he will fall away from the true teaching.

_Yasmiṃ bhikkhave puggale puggalo abhippasanno hoti so tathārūpaṃ

shadow (Dh.v.2).

-- 'Out of faith, Ānanda, you speak (_pasādā kho tvaṃ ānanda vadesi_),
but the Perfect One, Ānanda, has the actual knowledge that there is not one
bhikkhu in this assembly of bhikkhus who is unsure or uncertain about the

[quote, M.1.234-5]
____
A disciple of mine... perceives all bodily form according to reality with
perfect penetrative discernment as "not [in reality] mine," "not [in reality]

____

[quote, A.5.313]
____

_yathābhūtaṃ jānāmi passāmī ti._
____

===== With dhamma

In its exalted sense, _passati_ is sometimes linked to _dhamma_, which together
means 'see the nature of reality' and is equivalent to arahantship. The
parentheses in this section will be explained in the following section.

[quote, S.3.132-3]
____
Who could possibly explain the teaching to me such that I might see the nature
of reality?

_ko nu kho me tathā dhammaṃ deseyya yathāhaṃ dhammaṃ passeyyan ti._

____

[quote, Dh.v.259]
____

very being, and is not negligent of the practice, is truly expert in the
teaching.

_Yo ca appampi sutvāna dhammaṃ kāyena passati sa ve dhammadharo hoti yo
dhammaṃ nappamajjati._
____

===== Exalted sense: objectless

In its exalted sense, _passati_ is sometimes objectless. We have noticed this
already in the parentheses of the previous paragraph. This is the aspect which
justifies our particular interest in the word. For sentences to remain
comprehensible, some exalted noun or adverb needs adding. We do this in
accordance with word combinations noted above. Accordingly:

1. for the noun, we parenthesise _dhammaṃ_ (='see [the nature of reality]')

2. for the adverb we parenthesise _yathābhūtaṃ_ (='see [according to
reality]').

===== Noun parentheses

Similar parentheses may need adding to _passato_:

[quote, Ud.79]
____
For one who sees [the nature of reality], there is [nowhere] anything at all.

_passato natthi kiñcanaṃ ti._
____

[quote, It.21]
____
For one who sees [the nature of reality], attachment is destroyed.

_passato upadhikkhayaṃ._
____

===== Synonym parentheses

The same parentheses may need adding to synonyms. For example, in the following
quote, _na dissati_ is linked to _yathābhūtaṃ_. Therefore the _adassanā_
that follows stands for _yathābhūtaṃ adassanā_:

[quote, "Sn.v.194, Sn.v.206"]
____
Camouflaged by skin, the body is not seen according to reality
(_yathābhūtaṃ na dissati_)...

_Chaviyā kāyo paṭicchanno yathābhūtaṃ na dissati..._

(...) Whoever would think to be swelled-headed because of such a body, or
would disparage another, what is this except not seeing it [according to
reality] (_adassanā_)?

_(...) kimaññatra adassanā ti_
____

===== Vipassati: to see [according to reality]; to see [the nature of reality]

We treat _vipassati_ as _passati_ in its exalted form, parenthesising
accordingly:

[quote, Dh.v.174]
____
Spiritually blind is this world [of beings]: few [men] here see [the nature of
reality].

_Andhabhūto ayaṃ loko tanuk'ettha vipassati._
____

[quote, Sn.v.1115]
____
Knowing the arising of nonexistence [according to reality], and knowing that
spiritually fettering delight is a tie to individual existence, knowing this
thus, then he sees this matter [according to reality].

_Ākiñcaññasambhavaṃ ñatvā nandi saṃyojanaṃ iti +
Evametaṃ abhiññāya tato tattha vipassati._
____

[quote, Th.v.1091]
____
Seeing all states of individual existence [according to reality] as unlasting?
This wish of mine, when, oh when, will it be [fulfilled]?

_Aniccato sabbabhavaṃ vipassaṃ taṃ me idaṃ taṃ nu kadā bhavissati._
____

Sometimes it is not necessary to parenthesise, because the qualification is
explicit:

[quote, Th.v.1071]
____
There is not such delight in the music of the fivefold ensemble as there is for
one with an undistracted mind who rightly sees the nature of reality.

=== Pahitatta

==== Renderings

- _pahitatta_: resolute

- _pahitatta_: resolutely

- _pahitatta_: resolutely applied [to the practice]

- _pahitatta_: resolutely applied [to inward striving]

==== Introduction

===== Padahati and pahitatta

_Padahati_ means 'to strive', for example:

[quote, D.2.312]
____
In this regard a bhikkhu stirs up eagerness, endeavours, applies energy, exerts
his mind, and strives to prevent the arising of unarisen unvirtuous,
spiritually unwholesome factors.

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu anuppannānaṃ pāpakānaṃ akusalānaṃ
dhammānaṃ anuppādāya chandaṃ janeti vāyamati viriyaṃ ārabhati
cittaṃ paggaṇhāti padahati._
____

Although _pahita_ is the past participle of _padahati_, it only occurs in the
compound _pahitatta_. The relationship between the _padahati_ and _pahita_ can
be seen in the following quote:

[quote, M.1.480]
____
Enthusiastically applying himself [to the teaching], he scrutinises [it].

_ussahitvā tuleti_

(...) Having scrutinised [it], he strives [to practise it].

_tulayitvā padahati_

(...) Being resolutely applied [to the practice] he realises with his very being
the supreme truth, and he sees [the nature of reality] having penetrated it
with discernment.

_pahitatto samāno kāyena ceva paramaṃ saccaṃ sacchikaroti paññāya ca
naṃ paṭivijjha passati._
____

The -_atta_ suffix is therefore shown to be redundant. For further notes see
IGPT sv _Attā_.

===== Pahitatta: renderings of the -atta suffix

We have noted that the past participle of _padahati_ occurs in the compound
_pahitatta_ ('strived self'). The PED says it occurs only in this compound,
i.e. there is no word _pahita_. In their translations, Horner, Norman, and PED
attempt to incorporate the _atta_ suffix. See below. Like Bodhi, we ourselves
regard the -_atta_ suffix as redundant. The same redundancy is seen also in
_sukhitattā_ (May they be happy, _bhavantu sukhitattā,_ Sn.v.145) and
_samāhitatto_ (inwardly collected, S.1.169). For further notes, see Glossary
sv _Attā_.

===== Pahitatta: qualifiers

_Pahitatta_ often occurs in the scriptures without qualification. We consider
it to be an abbreviation that should be parenthesised in translation according
to suttas where it is linked to some qualifier. In the following quotes it is
linked to inward striving (_padhāna_) and 'practising as I instructed him'
(_yathā mayānusiṭṭhaṃ tathā paṭipajjamāno_). We usually choose to
render it in accordance with the second quote as 'resolutely applied [to the
practice]' (i.e. 'as I instruct him'), because the first quote refers to the
Buddha's practice before his enlightenment, that is, before the discovery of
the teaching and the practice of the teaching.

[quote, Sn.v.425-6]
____
While I was nearby the Nerañjara River, resolutely applied to inward striving.

_Taṃ maṃ padhānapahitattaṃ nadiṃ nerañjaraṃ pati._

We have made similar comments about _Ātāpī_ (sv _Ātāpī_). _Ātāpī_
likewise occurs in the scriptures without qualification. We consider _ātāpī_
to be an abbreviation to be parenthesised in translation, and we therefore
render it as 'vigorously applied [to the practice]':

=== Pāragata; Pāragū

==== Renderings

- _pāragū_: reached the Far Shore

- _pāragū_: reached the far shore

- _pāragū_: gone beyond (something)

- _pāragū_: master (of the three Vedas)

- _pāragato_: reached the Far Shore

==== Introduction

===== 'Far Shore': nibbāna

[quote, Sn.v.1130]
____
'Far Shore' (_pāraṃ_) means _nibbāna_. The _Pārāyanavaggo_ indicates this
when it says one would go from the Near Shore to the Far Shore if one developed
the Supreme Way.

_Apārā pāraṃ gaccheyya bhāvento maggamuttamaṃ._
____

===== 'Near Shore': personal identity?

The (capitalised) 'Near Shore' likely means personal identity, because the
simile in the _Āsivisopama Sutta_ (S.4.172) says the near shore of a great
expanse of water (_orimaṃ tīraṃ_) is a metaphor for personal identity
(_sakkāyassetaṃ adhivacanaṃ_) and the far shore (_pārimaṃ tīraṃ_) is
a metaphor for Nibbāna (_nibbānassetaṃ adhivacanaṃ_).

===== Arahant: pāragato or pāragū

Therefore, because he has attained to Nibbāna, the arahant is 'one who has
reached the Far Shore,' either _pāragato_ (S.4.157) or _pāragū_ (Sn.v.372).

===== Pāraṅgata vs. Pāragata

_Pāraṅgata_ and _pāragata_ stem from _paraṃ_ and _para_. PED explains the
words as synonyms, as follows:

- _Pāragata_: 'one who has reached the opposite shore.'

- _Pāraṅgata_: 'gone to the other side, gone beyond, traversed, transcended.'

Pāli versions disagree on the spelling. For example, VRI usually spells
_pāraṅgata_ and commonly ascribes _pāragata_ to BJT, as follows:

1. _pāraṅgato_ [_pāragato_ (sī. syā. kaṃ.)] (S.4.174).

2. _pāraṅgato_ [pāragato (sī. syā. kaṃ.)] (A.2.5).

3. _pāraṅgato_ [_pāragato_ (sī. syā. kaṃ.)] (A.4.11).

4. _pāraṅgatā_ [_pāragatā_ (sī. syā. pī.)] (A.4.228).

5. _pāraṅgatā_ [_pāragatā_ (ka. sī. syā.)] (It.50).

6. _tiṇṇo pāraṅgato_ [_pāragato_ (sī. aṭṭha. syā.)] (It.57).

However, VRI itself occasionally spells _pāragata_. For example, in
combination with _tiṇṇo_, the ratio is 11:2 as follows:

1. _tiṇṇaṃ pāraṅgataṃ_ (Sn.v.359).

2. _tiṇṇā pāraṅgatā_ (A.4.411).

3. _tiṇṇo pāraṅgato_ (M.2.196).

4. _tiṇṇo pāraṅgato_ (S.4.156).

5. _tiṇṇo pāraṅgato_ (S.4.174).

6. _tiṇṇo pāraṅgato_ (S.4.175).

7. _tiṇṇo pāraṅgato_ (A.2.5).

8. _tiṇṇo hoti pāraṅgato_ (A.4.11).

9. _tiṇṇo pāraṅgato_ (It.57).

10. _tiṇṇo pāraṅgato_ (Sn.v.638).

11. _tiṇṇo pāraṅgato_ (Th.v.680).

But:

1. _tiṇṇo pāragato_ (Dh.v.414).

2. _tiṇṇo pāragato_ (Sn.v.21).

On the basis of these findings, we normalise spellings in the Glossary and in
our translations to _pāragato_.

===== Pāraguṃ and pāragū: qualified

Where _pāraguṃ_ and _pāragū_ are qualified they still indicate
arahantship, and should be rendered as 'gone beyond [something]' For example:

- _pāragū dukkhassa_: gone beyond suffering (Sn.v.539).

- _jātimaraṇassa pāragā_: gone beyond birth and death (S.4.71).

===== Pāragū: master (of the three Vedas)

_Pāragū_ can also mean that a brahman scholar is 'master' of the three Vedas:
_tiṇṇaṃ vedānaṃ pāragū_ (A.1.163).

=== Pārāyana; Parāyaṇa

==== Renderings

- _pārāyana_: the way to the Far Shore

- _parāyaṇa_: means of survival

- _parāyaṇa_: destiny

- _parāyaṇa_: support

- _parāyaṇa_: final destination

- _parāyaṇa_: Final Destination (i.e. _nibbāna_)

==== Introduction

===== Parāyaṇa and Parāyana

These words are synonyms, though PED is silent on the matter. VRI has not
normalised them, and thus both spellings are found there. For example,
_sambodhiparāyaṇaṃ_ and _-naṃ._ For computer studies this is
unsatisfactory, and we have normalised this Glossary to _parāyaṇaṃ_ in
accordance with both Vedic and Sanskrit spellings.

===== Parāyaṇa from parā

_Parāyaṇa_ is derived from _parā+i_, where _parā_ is '_para+ā_. Ā is the
directional prefix emphasizing _para.'_ This meaning is seen, for example, when
Nibbāna is called 'the final destination' (_parāyaṇa_, S.4.373), and with
the stream-enterer, who has enlightenment as his destiny
(_sambodhiparāyaṇo,_ A.4.11-13).

===== Parāyaṇa: support

The meaning 'support' is shown here:

- In this regard one sees that very same lady after some time, eighty or ninety
or a hundred years old, aged, as bent as a rafter, crooked, supported by a
walking stick (_daṇḍaparāyaṇaṃ_), wobbling as she goes (M.1.88).

===== Parāyaṇa: means of survival

The meaning 'means of survival' can be seen here:

[quote, S.1.38]
____
-- What is it that produces a person? What does he have that runs around? What
enters upon the round of birth and death? What is his means of survival?

_Kiṃ su janeti purisaṃ kiṃ su tassa vidhāvati +
Kiṃ su saṃsāramāpādi kiṃ su tassa parāyaṇan ti_

-- It is craving that produces a person; his thoughts are what runs around; a
being enters upon the round of birth and death; his merit is his means of
survival.

_Taṇhā janeti purisaṃ cittamassa vidhāvati +
Satto saṃsāramāpādi kammaṃ tassa parāyaṇan ti._
____

That merit is a means of survival is seen in this quote:

[quote, S.1.93]
____
Therefore one should do what is meritorious as a collection for a future life.
Meritorious deeds are the support for living beings [when they arise] in the
world hereafter."

_Tasmā kareyya kalyāṇaṃ nicayaṃ samparāyikaṃ puññāni
paralokasmiṃ patiṭṭhā honti pāṇinanti._
____

===== Parāyaṇa and Pārāyana: not synonyms

PED says _pārāyana_ is the metric form of _parāyaṇa_. But Norman points
out that Monier Williams (Sanskrit-English Dictionary) 'does not, however,
quote such a metrical form' (GD, note on p.218.18, GD p.423).

===== Pārāyana from pāraṃ: 'the way to the Far Shore'

_Pārāyana_ occurs in relation to the fifth chapter of the _Suttanipāta_. Its
spelling and meaning are derived from _pāraṃ,_ i.e. 'Far Shore':

[quote, Sn.v.1130]
____
This path is for going to the Far Shore, therefore it is called the way to the
Far Shore.

_Maggo so pāraṃ gamanāya tasmā pārāyanaṃ iti._

=== Piya

==== Renderings

- _piya_: agreeable

- _piya_: beloved

==== Introduction

===== Two spheres: sattā vā piyā, sankhārā vā piyā

PED accepts the two applications of _piya_ noted in the commentary, viz: _dve
piyā: sattā vā piyā sankhārā vā piyā_, with reference to 1) living
beings, 2) sensations.

We likewise recognise this division.

1. Beings are beloved or unbeloved.

2. Sense impression is agreeable or disagreeable.

In the context of ascetic renunciation, 'beloved' fits better than 'agreeable':

[quote, Sn.v.811]
____
The sage is not attached in any way. He does not hold anything as either
beloved or unbeloved.

_Sabbattha muni anissito na piyaṃ kubbati no pi appiyaṃ._

=== Puthujjana

==== Renderings

- _puthujjana_: Everyman

- _puthujjana_: common man

==== Introduction

===== Puthujjana vs. ariyasāvaka

_Puthujjano_ usually occurs in the suttas as _assutavā puthujjano_, the
ignorant Everyman. The _assutavā puthujjano_ is repeatedly contrasted with the
learned noble disciple, _sutavā ariyasāvako_.

===== Puthujjana: options

Because _puthujjano_ usually occurs with an adjective like _assutavā_,
rendering it as 'common man' or 'ordinary person' is avoided here, because it
results in double adjectives. The _assutavā puthujjano_ would be an 'ignorant,
ordinary person' or an 'ignorant, common man,' which are clumsy and
condemnatory.

Words like 'commoner' or 'plebeian' are unuseable because they designate
members of a lower social class, where _puthujjano_ implies averageness without
implications of class.

===== Puthujjana: the Everyman

Everyman is the allegorical character in The Summoning of Everyman, a 15^th^
Century morality play in which the central figure represents the common man.
The spelling is either 'everyman' or 'Everyman.' Capitalisation is chosen here
because it emphasises the individuality of the ordinary man, his helplessness,
and pitifulness.

===== Puthujjano: contexts without an adjective

Where _puthujjana_ occurs without an adjective, we render it 'common man.' As a
plural we render it 'common men':

[quote, Th.v.575]
____
The foolish common men who cherish this [wretched human] body

_Yemaṃ kāyaṃ mamāyanti andhabālā puthujjanā._
____

===== The Summoning of Everyman: synopsis

The synopsis of the play _The Summoning of Everyman_ is this:

God commands Death to summon Everyman to make his final reckoning. Death allows
Everyman a companion for the journey to speak for his virtues. Most of
Everyman's friends refuse to accompany him, for example Fellowship, who
represents Everyman's friends, and Kindred, who represents his family.

Goods refuses, saying that since Everyman was so devoted to gathering Goods,
but never shared them, Goods' presence would make God's judgement more severe.

Good Deeds says she is too weak to go because Everyman has never appreciated
her. But, in the presence of Confession, Everyman repents of his sins, and as a
result, Good Deeds becomes strong enough to accompany him on his final journey.
Everyman then climbs into his grave with Good Deeds. They ascend into heaven
where they are warmly welcomed.

The play closes with the Doctor, representing a scholar, explaining the moral:
in the end, man will only have Good Deeds to accompany him beyond the grave.

About the author of the play, nothing is known.

When the ignorant Everyman is affected by unpleasant bodily sense impression,
he grieves, suffers, and laments, weeps beating his chest, and falls into
bewilderment. This is called the ignorant Everyman who has not risen up in the
bottomless abyss, one who has not gained a foothold.

==== Introduction

===== Purekkharoti and purakkharoti

That _purekkharoti_ and _purakkharoti_ are variant spellings is supported by
PED and Bodhi (CDB p.1049 n.25).

===== Purekkharoti: verb

_Purakkharoti_ ('to esteem') occurs just once in the scriptures as follows:

[quote, Sn.v.803]
____
They neither conceive [views], nor [at all] esteem them.

_Na kappayanti na purekkharonti._
____

It occurs more frequently as the absolutive (_purakkhatvā_) or past participle
(_purakkhato_).

===== Purakkhatvā: absolutive

The absolutive _purakkhatvā_ is used with the accusative case, and has five
meanings which can be illustrated as follows:

1. 'face': facing the Blessed One
+
****
_bhagavantaṃ yeva purakkhatvā_ (D.3.208).
****

2. 'put at the front': bhikkhus putting me at the front
+
****
_mameva bhikkhū purakkhatvā_ (M.1.28).
****

3. 'give precedence': giving precedence to Venerable MahāMoggallāna

****

4. 'esteem': esteeming wisdom

****

5. 'revere': we shall abide revering you
+
****
_Purakkhatvā vihassāma_ (Thī.v.121).
****

===== Purakkhato: past participle

The past participle forms (1) adjectives (2) adverbs and (3) prepositions. It
occurs with six cases: nominative, accusative, instrumental, genitive, dative,
and locative, though in _tappurisa_ compounds the case ending is elided.
Duroiselle illustrates elision with two examples:

1. _araññaṃ gato_ becomes _araññagato_;

2. _buddena bhāsito_ becomes _buddhabhāsito_ (PGPL, Para.545).

The past participle has nine meanings:

1. '[much] esteemed': [much] esteemed doctrines
+
****
_dhammā purakkhatā_ (Sn.v.784).
****

2. 'exposed': he is exposed to cold and heat
+
****
_sītassa purakkhato uṇhassa purakkhato_ (M.1.85).
****

3. 'led on': people led on by craving scurry about like hunted hares.
+
****
_Tasiṇāya purakkhatā pajā parisappanti saso va bādhito_ (Dh.v.342).
****

4. 'accompanied': accompanied by a crowd of slave women
+
****
_dāsīgaṇapurakkhatā_ (Th.v.299).
****

5. 'followed': followed by flies

****

6. 'revered': he is revered by the heavenly musicians
+
****
_gandhabbehi purakkhato_ (D.3.197).
****

7. 'at the head of': at the head of a group of elephants
+
****

****

8. 'in front of': in front of the assembly of bhikkhus
+
****
_bhikkhusaṅghapurakkhato_ (Sn.v.1015).
****

9. 'give precedence': he is given precedence amongst the group of bhikkhus
+
****
_purakkhato bhikkhugaṇassa majjhe_ (D.2.135).
****

===== Purekkharāno

_Purekkharāno_ means one who either 1) nurses hopes or 2) esteems views:

1. And how does one nurse hopes [for the future]? In this regard, some person
thinks: May my bodily form be thus in the future; sense impression; perception;
intentional activities; advertence.
+
****
_Kathañca gahapati purekkharāno hoti: idha gahapati ekaccassa evaṃ hoti:
evaṃrūpo siyaṃ anāgatamaddhānaṃ evaṃvedano siyaṃ
anāgatamaddhānaṃ evaṃsañño siyaṃ anāgatamaddhānaṃ
evaṃsaṅkhāro siyaṃ anāgatamaddhānaṃ evaṃviññāṇo siyaṃ
anāgatamaddhānanti_ (S.3.11).
****

2. He [much] esteems the dogmatic view he has conceived.
+
****
_pakappitaṃ diṭṭhiṃ purekkharāno_ (Sn.v.910).
****

===== Esteem qualified

Webster's Dictionary says 'regard' is usually qualified: 'he is not highly
regarded in the profession.' But the same applies to 'esteem': 'he is not
highly esteemed in the profession.' We therefore render _purekkharoti_ as 'to
esteem', or 'to [much] esteem', or 'to [at all] esteem':

[quote, Sn.v.803]
____
They neither conceive [views], nor [at all] esteem them.

=== Pūtimutta

==== Renderings

- _pūtimutta_: concentrated urine

==== Introduction

===== Pūtimutta is not 'rotten urine'

_Pūti_ can mean rotten:

[quote, M.1.89]
____
bones rotted and crumbled to dust

_aṭṭhikāni pūtīni cuṇṇakajātāni._
____

[quote, M.1.73]
____
beings born in a rotten fish, in a rotten corpse, in rotten porridge

_sattā pūtimacche vā jāyanti pūtikuṇape vā pūtikummāse vā._
____

But _pūtimutta_, a consumable medicine, would not be 'rotten urine' because:

1. rotten urine would likely be poisonous.

2. the medicinal effectiveness of any product would hardly be improved by
allowing it to rot.

3. Allowing urine to 'ferment' would require sterile equipment, and the Buddha
made no allowance for any such equipment. Further, accumulating clay or shell
vessels would be an impossible and ridiculous burden for bhikkhus living at the
roots of trees. Thus _pūtimutta_ was likely a product to be consumed without
storage.

PED calls _pūtimutta_ strong-smelling urine.

===== Pūtimutta is ordinary urine

_Pūtimutta_ is likely the same as ordinary urine (_mutta_) because both are
used in the treatment of jaundice:

[quote, Vin.1.206]
____
Now at that time a certain bhikkhu had jaundice. They informed the Blessed One
about it. [He said:] "I allow you, bhikkhus, to make him drink [a compound of]
urine (_mutta_) and yellow myrobalan."

_Tena kho pana samayena aññatarassa bhikkhuno paṇḍurogābādho hoti.
Bhagavato etamatthaṃ ārocesuṃ. Anujānāmi bhikkhave muttaharīṭakaṃ
pāyetun ti._
____

[quote, M.1.316]
____
Suppose there were concentrated urine (_pūtimuttaṃ_) mixed with various
medicines, and a man came sick with jaundice...

_Seyyathāpi bhikkhave pūtimuttaṃ nānābhesajjehi saṃsaṭṭhaṃ atha
puriso āgaccheyya paṇḍurogī._
____

===== Pūtimutta has no medicinal properties

_Pūtimutta_ likely has no medicinal properties for several reasons:

1. In the previous paragraph, the phrase _pūtimuttaṃ nānābhesajjehi
saṃsaṭṭhaṃ_ suggests that urine is merely a vehicle for medicinal
substances.

2. _Pūtimutta_ is nowhere prescribed by the Buddha as a treatment in itself,
but only together with other substances, for example with jaundice above, or
for the treatment of snakebite, where it is the base into which dung, ashes,
and clay can be mixed (Vin.1.206).

3. _Pūtimutta_ is linked in medicinal importance with ghee, butter, oil,
honey, and molasses.
+
[quote, Vin.1.58]
____
Going forth [into the ascetic life] is with the support of _pūtimutta_ as
medicine. You should make an effort with this for the rest of your life. The
extra requisites are ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses.

_Pūtimuttabhesajjaṃ nissāya pabbajjā. Tattha te yāvajīvaṃ ussāho
karaṇiyo. Atirekalābho sappi navatītaṃ telaṃ madhu phāṇitanti.._
____
+
Ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses are 'medicinal' only in respect of their
nutritive properties:
+
[quote, V.1.200]
____
These five remedies, that is to say ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, molasses,
are remedies and are also agreed upon as remedies, and although they serve as
nutriment for people yet they cannot be reckoned as substantial food.

_imāni kho pañca bhesajjāni seyyathīdaṃ sappi navanītaṃ telaṃ madhu
phāṇitaṃ bhesajjāni ceva bhesajjasammatāni ca lokassa āhāratthañca
pharanti na ca oḷāriko āhāro paññāyati._
____
+
It is accordance with this to regard _pūtimutta_ as useful only for its
nutritive properties, which we will consider below.

4. When the Buddha was sick his resource was often simply hot or tepid water.
For example, Upavāna was the Buddha's attendant at a time when he was affected
by 'winds.'
+
[quote, S.1.174]
____
Please, find me some hot water.

_ingha me uṇh'odakaṃ jānāhi._
____
+
Some of the water was for bathing, and some for drinking with molasses. Then,
again, after consuming Cunda's _sūkaramaddava_, and being attacked a painful
and bloody illness, sitting at the root of a tree, he said:
+
[quote, D.2.128]
____
Ānanda, please bring me water. I am thirsty, Ānanda, and need [something] to
drink.

_iṅgha me tvaṃ ānanda pānīyaṃ āhara pipāsito'mhi ānanda pivissāmī ti._
____

===== Pūtimutta: not cows' urine

[quote, A.2.27]
____
In the category of remedies, _pūtimutta_ is paltry, easily gotten, and
blameless.

_Pūtimuttaṃ bhikkhave bhesajjānaṃ appañca sulabhañca tañca
anavajjaṃ._
____

Because _pūtimutta_ is said to be easily gotten, it is unlikely that cows'
urine is meant. This would be awkward, ridiculous, and potentially dangerous to
collect, especially by bhikkhus living solitary lives in the forest.

===== Pūtimutta: source of ketone bodies and electrolytes

Venerable Kassapa fasted during illness (Ud.4), and his _Theragāthā_ verses
show that he keenly promoted _pūtimutta_ (Th.v.1057). Drinking urine would
preserve electrolytes, particularly sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and
phosphorus. The kidney's ability to retain these electrolytes takes up to ten
days to adjust to fasting conditions. Drinking urine would reduce these
obligatory losses and may therefore help prevent the refeeding syndrome which
we discuss below:

- Early in fasting, weight loss is rapid... During the period of rapid weight
loss, there is significant negative sodium balance, probably due to losses of
the sodium salts of keto acids in the urine. (Fasting: The History,
Pathophysiology, and Complications: Kerndt et al, West J Med 1982.)

- Potassium losses decrease after ten days of fasting though some losses
persist. Magnesium, calcium, and phosphorous losses are minimal after the first
week. (Fasting: The History, Pathophysiology, and Complications: Kerndt et al,
West J Med 1982.)

- Renal potassium conservation develops relatively slowly in response to
decreases in dietary potassium and is far less efficient than the kidneys'
ability to conserve sodium. (www. merckmanuals.com.)

- Obligatory renal K+ loss is around 15 mmol/day, so it is reasonable to
consider the minimal K+ intake necessary to maintain an extracellular fluid K+
within the normal range to be at least 25 mmol/day. (Core Concepts in the
Disorders of Fluid, Electrolytes and Acid-Base Balance, ed. Mount et al.,
Springer 2013)

===== Pūtimutta: rules on offering

_Pūtimutta_ can be consumed by bhikkhus without needing to be formally offered:

[quote, Vin.1.206]
____
I allow that [item] which one receives while producing it as having been
properly received while being produced. It does not need to be received again.

_Anujānāmi bhikkhave yaṃ karonto patigaṇhāti sveva paṭiggaho kato
hoti. Na puna paṭiggahāpetabbo ti._
____

===== Danger of consuming urine

Some drugs are excreted in urine in their active form, for example, atenolol,
cimetidine, digoxin, penicillin, quinine, salicylate, tetracycline, and
thiazide diuretics.

===== Danger of fasting

1. Re-feeding syndrome is a potentially fatal illness that can occur following
5-10 days of fasting, if food is introduced too suddenly, particularily in
patients with a low body mass, and with previous malnourishment.

2. Its hallmark is hypophosphataemia due to the insulin surge.

3. It may also involve alteration in sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium
balances; and in glucose, protein, and fat metabolism.

4. Refeeding should be started at no more than 50% of energy requirements, then
gradually increased over 4-7 days.

5. Rehydration should be done cautiously.

6. Thiamine (vitamin B1, 200-300mg daily) supplementation should be used for at
least 10 days to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's syndrome.

Source: Refeeding syndrome: what it is, and how to prevent and treat it,
Mehanna et al. British Medical Journal, June 2008.

===== Consuming urine: foul practice

The Buddha allowed concentrated urine to be consumed, but it is nonetheless
considered filthy practice:

[quote, M.1.79]
____
As long as my own excrement and urine lasted, I fed on my own excrement and
urine. Such was my great practice of feeding on filth.

_yāvakīvañca me sāriputta sakaṃ muttakarīsaṃ apariyādiṇṇaṃ hoti
sakaṃ yeva sudaṃ muttakarīsaṃ āhāremi. Idaṃ su me sāriputta
mahāvikaṭabhojanasmiṃ hoti._
____

===== Uses of unconcentrated urine

1. Unconcentrated mid-stream urine is a sterile fluid that may be useful in
treating superficial wounds. Concentrated urine would be too salty.

2. Water consumed from village wells during almsround could be a later source
of liquid for the afternoon meditation period.

In this regard, someone is likeable, loveable, and dear to another, so when
others treat the former as likeable, loveable, and dear, the latter thinks: 'He
who is to me likeable, loveable, and dear is treated by others as likeable,
loveable, and dear' and he therefore evokes affection for them. Thus is
affection born of affection.

How is hatred born from affection?

thinks: 'He who is to me likeable, loveable, and dear is treated by others as
unlikeable, unloveable, and loathsome' and he therefore evokes hatred for them.
Thus is hatred born of affection.

- _baddha_: bound

- _baddha_: tied up

- _baddha_: confined

- _baddha_: held captive

- _baddha_: emotionally bound

- _baddha_: bound [to individual existence]

==== Introduction

===== Baddha: bound [to individual existence]

We explain how _baddha_ means 'bound [to individual existence]' via two
passages.

===== Passage 1: baddho so mārabandhanena, bound [to individual existence] by Māra's bond

_Baddho so mārabandhanena_ occurs in this passage:

[quote, S.4.92]
____
There are visible objects known via the visual sense that are likeable,
loveable, pleasing, agreeable, connected with sensuous pleasure, and charming.
If a bhikkhu takes delight in them, welcomes them, persists in cleaving to
them, this is called a bhikkhu who has entered Māra's lair, who has come under
Māra's control, who is trapped in Māra's snare, who is bound [to individual
existence] by Māra's bond. The Maleficent One can do with him as he wishes.

_Santi bhikkhave cakkhuviññeyyā rūpā iṭṭhā kantā manāpā piyarūpā
kāmūpasaṃhitā rajanīyā tañce bhikkhu abhinandati abhivadati ajjhosāya
tiṭṭhati ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave bhikkhu āvāsagato mārassa mārassa
vasaṅgato paṭimukkassa mārapāso baddho so mārabandhanena
yathākāmakaraṇīyo pāpimato._
____

Māra's bond is _mārabandhana_ (S.1.24; S.4.92) or _mārasaṃyoga_
(Sn.v.733). Māra's bond means bondage [to individual existence], as this quote
shows:

[quote, Sn.v.733]
____
Having overcome Māra's tie [that ties one to renewed states of individual
existence], they do not come to renewed states of individual existence.

_Abhibhuyya mārasaṃyogaṃ nāgacchanti punabbhavan ti._
____

Therefore _baddho so mārabandhanena_, means 'bound [to individual existence]
by Māra's bond.'

===== Passage 2: mohena baddhā, bound [to individual existence] by undiscernment of reality

_Mohena baddhā_ occurs in this passage:

[quote, A.2.72]
____
Attached to charming things; taking delight in what is agreeable; vile
creatures bound [to individual existence] by undiscernment of reality,
reinforce that bondage.

_sārattā rajanīyesu piyarūpābhinandino +
Mohena adhamā sattā baddhā vaḍḍhenti bandhanaṃ._
____

That _baddhā_ means bound [to individual existence] is proven by its
association with _bandhanaṃ_. That _bandhana_ means bondage [to individual
existence] can be shown in three ways:

1. It is sometimes explicit:
+
[quote, S.1.35]
____
Through understanding your teaching they severed the bondage to individual
existence.

_Yassa te dhammamaññāya acchiduṃ bhavabandhanaṃ._
____

2. Sometimes the meaning is conveyed through its association with words like
_saṃyojana_:
+
[quote, D.2.274]
____
Like the elephant that bursts all its fastenings and chains, they severed the
ties and bonds [to individual existence] in the sensuous plane of existence,
those ties of the Maleficent One so hard to overcome.

_Te kāmasaṃyojanabandhanāni pāpimayogāni duraccayāni nāgoca
sandānaguṇāni chetvā._
____

3. Sometimes, the context implies it. For example here, where its link to
_bhava_ is proven by its link to _taṇhā_:
+
[quote, S.1.8]
____
Craving you call bondage [to individual existence].

_taṇhaṃ me brūsi bandhanan ti._
____
+
[quote, S.3.26]
____
Craving that leads to renewed states of individual existence

_taṇhā ponobhavikā._
____

Therefore _mohena baddhā_ means 'bound [to individual existence] by
undiscernment of reality.'

- _brahmacariya_: celibacy

- _brahmacariya_: the practice of celibacy

- _brahmacārino_: celibate

- _abrahmacāriṃ_: not celibate

==== Introduction

===== Brahmacariya: religious life

The religious life (_brahmacariya_) is practised by all the Buddha's disciples,
whether ordained or not, whether celibate or not. Thus:

1. Sakka, surrounded by nymphs called Moggallāna his _sabrahmacārī_:

- _Sabrahmacārī me eso āyasmā mahāmoggallāno ti_ (M.1.255).

2. Māra invited the Buddha to return to lay life, and called it
_brahmacariyaṃ_:

[quote, Sn.v.428]
____
'By living the religious life, by making offerings to the sacrificial fire,
much merit will be heaped up by you.

_Carato ca te brahmacariyaṃ aggihuttañca juhato +
Pahūtaṃ cīyate puññaṃ kiṃ padhānena kāhasi._
____

===== Brahmacariya: celibate life

The celibate life (_brahmacariya_) is practised by all ordained disciples, and
by some lay disciples. For arahants celibacy means avoiding all forms of
sexuality including sexual thoughts, which is a blemish of the celibate life
(_Idampi kho brāhmaṇa brahmacariyassa khaṇḍampi chiddampi sabalampi
kammāsampi_: see _Methuna Sutta_, A.4.54).

===== Action noun: 'the practice of celibacy'

_Brahmacariya_ means 'religious life', 'celibate life', or 'celibacy'. But
where the context implies an action noun, it means 'the practice of celibacy.'
For 'religious life' to become an action noun, it is usually paired with an
action noun. For example: _Carato ca te brahmacariyaṃ_ ('By living the
religious life,' Sn.v.428).

So, consider three passages:

1. Austerity; the practice of celibacy; insight into the noble truths; the
realisation of the Untroubled: this is supremely auspicious.
+
****
_Tapo ca brahmacariyañca ariyasaccāna dassanaṃ +
****
Nibbānasacchikiriyā ca etaṃ maṅgalamuttamaṃ_ (Th.v.267).

2. The practice of celibacy: this they call the supreme power.
+
****
_Brahmacariyaṃ etadāhu vasuttamaṃ_ (Sn.v.274).
****

3. Unrestraint of the sense faculties is an obstacle to the practice of
celibacy.
+
****
_indriyāsaṃvaro brahmacariyassa paripantho_ (A.5.136).
****

=== Brāhmaṇa

==== Renderings

- _brāhmaṇa_: brahman (=member of the brahman social class)

- _brāhmaṇa_: Brahmanist (=adherent of the religion of the brahmans)

- _brāhmaṇa_: Brahman (=arahant, or one striving to be an arahant)

==== Introduction

===== Brāhmaṇa and the four classes: lower case

In the Buddha's time, Indian society had four classes: _khattiyas,_ brahmans,
_vessas,_ and _suddas_ (M.2.150). These four classes were not technically
castes because intermarriage was still possible. Some grammarians would
capitalise these groups. For example, Wikipedia says:

- 'Varna may be translated as "class," and refers to the four social classes
which existed in the Vedic society, namely Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and
Shudras.' http:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India

Many dictionaries say likewise. However, the Economist Style Guide supports us
in saying:

- 'Indian castes are lower case italic, except for brahman, which has now
become an English word and is therefore lower case roman (unless it is
mentioned along with several other less familiar caste names in italic)' (www.
economist.com/style-guide/capitals).

===== Brāhmaṇa as a religious term

In a religious context, we use the term 'Brahmanist.' Most translators would
call this 'Brahman,' but we reserve capitalised 'Brahman' for arahants.
Although unusual, Brahmanist is well-recognised:

- Brahmanist: an adherent of the religion of the brahmans (https://
en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Brahmanist).

We capitalise Brahmanist in accordance with established style manuals:

- Capitalization of religious terms: Baha'i, Baptist, Brahman, Buddhist...
Hindu; Hinduism, Islam; Islamic, Jewish... (U.S. Government Printing Office
Style Manual, 2008).

===== Brāhmaṇa: Brahman (=arahant, or one striving to be an arahant)

Where _brāhmaṇa_ means arahant, we capitalise it: Brahman. But sometimes
_brāhmaṇa_ is applied to those still striving to be Brahmans. Two examples:

[quote, Dh.v.389]
____
One should not strike a Brahman. [Likewise], a Brahman should not vent
[wrath on his assailant]. Shame on the one who strikes a Brahman! And shame on
[the Brahman] who vents [wrath on his assailant]!

_Na brāhmaṇassa pahareyya nāssa muñcetha brāhmaṇo +
Dhī brāhmaṇassa hantāraṃ tato dhī y'assa muñcati._
____

This, of course, means one should not strike an arahant, and one who is
striving to be an arahant should not vent his wrath.

[quote, Dh.v.390]
____
It is not worse for a Brahman when his mind is restrained from agreeable
things. The more his mind turns away from agreeable things the more his
miseries subside.

_Na brāhmaṇassetadakiñci seyyo yadā nisedho manaso piyehi +
Yato yato hiṃsamano nivattati tato tato sammatimeva dukkhaṃ._
____

Here again, where his miseries are still subsiding, _brāhmaṇa_ means 'one
striving to be a Brahman.'

==== Introduction

===== Bhava: individual existence

Rendering _bhava_ as 'individual existence' is justified for several reasons:

1. _Bhava_ is linked to 'the way one exists' (_bhūta_):
+
[quote, A.3.202]
____
In whatever way one exists such that there is the immediate destruction of
perceptually obscuring states is the foremost state of individual existence.

_Yathābhūtassa anantarā āsavānaṃ khayo hoti idaṃ bhavānaṃ aggan ti._
____

2. _Bhava_ is linked to an [absolute] Selfhood (_atta_):
+
[quote, It.44]
____
Some people are revolted, appalled, and disgusted by individual existence. They
long for the cessation of individual existence, saying, 'When that [absolute]
Selfhood is annihilated, destroyed, and does not exist with the demise of the
body at death, this is peaceful, this is sublime, this is reality.

_bhaveneva kho paneke aṭṭiyamānā harāyamāsā jigucchamānā vibhavaṃ

ucchijjati vinassati na hoti parammaraṇā etaṃ santaṃ etaṃ paṇītaṃ
etaṃ yathāvantī._
____

3. _Bhava_ is linked to the stream of sense consciousness (_viññāṇaṃ_):
+
[quote, A.1.223-4]
____
The stream of sense consciousness is established in the low plane of existence.
In this way renewed states of individual existence and rebirth occur in the
future.... This, Ānanda, is what is implied by the term 'individual existence.'

_Hīnāya dhātuyā viññāṇaṃ patiṭṭhitaṃ. Evaṃ āyatiṃ
punabbhavābhinibbatti hoti... evaṃ kho ānanda bhavo hotī ti._
____
+
That the stream of sense consciousness is equivalent to the individual
(_purisa_) is seen here:

[quote, D.3.105]
____
He comes to know man's stream of sense consciousness as an unbroken stream that
is established in both this world and the world beyond.

_purisassa ca viññāṇasotaṃ pajānāti ubhayato abbocchinnaṃ idha loke

4. _Bhava_ is linked to _puggala_:
+

____
And what is the carrier of the burden. The person, one should reply, this
Venerable of such a name and clan. This is called the carrier of the burden.
And what is the taking up of the burden? It is this craving that leads to
renewed states of individual existence.

____

Commentary: _Tattha bhavadiṭṭhī ti sassatadiṭṭhi. Vibhavadiṭṭhī
ti ucchedadiṭṭhi._

The two views can be illustrated as follows:

===== Vibhavadiṭṭhi: cessation of beings [at death]

The view of the cessation of beings [at death] is illustrated in this quote:

[quote, D.1.34]
____
There are some ascetics and Brahmanists who are annihilationists. They assert
the annihilation, destruction, and cessation of beings [at death]

_santi bhikkhave eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā ucchedavādā sato sattassa
ucchedaṃ vināsaṃ vibhavaṃ paññāpenti._
____

===== Bhavadiṭṭhi: continuance of beings [at death]

The view of the continuance of beings [at death] is illustrated in this quote:

[quote, M.2.228]
____
Bhikkhus, there are some ascetics and Brahmanists who speculate about the
future and who hold dogmatic views concerning the future, who make various
assertions about the future. They assert that the [absolute] Selfhood is
perceptive... unperceptive... neither perceptive nor unperceptive and
unimpaired after death

_santi bhikkhave eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā aparantakappikā

____

===== Tibhavā: three planes of existence

The universe is comprised of three planes of existence (_dhātu_), which are
named according to two systems:

1. the low plane of existence, the middle plane of existence, and the high
plane of existence, or,
+

Comment:

_Bhavena_ and _vibhavena_ are parenthesised to help make sense. Otherwise the
sutta would say that 'Whatever ascetics and Brahmanists have said that
deliverance from individual existence is through the ending of individual
existence, none of them, I declare have escaped individual existence.' This
would be perplexing, given that the ending of individual existence is
_nibbāna_ (_bhavanirodho nibbānaṃ_ A.5.9).

The sutta means that the end of individual existence is not brought about by
ending any particular state of existence. The next excerpt says that the end of
individual existence is accomplished through abandoning craving (_bhavataṇhā
pahīyati_).

He knows that, 'If I were to direct this detached awareness so purified and

mind accordingly, thus this detached awareness supported and fuelled by this
would remain for a very long time.

==== Introduction

===== Bhavabhava: in verse

The term _bhavābhava_ occurs 20 times in the scriptures, always in poems,
except for one passage in the _Madhupiṇḍika Sutta_ which is so lyrical as
to be practically verse, which begins:

[quote, M.1.108]
____
[I proclaim] a doctrine, friend, such that in the world [of beings] with its
devas, māras, and brahmās, in the world of mankind with its ascetics and
Brahmanists, its royalty and commoners, one does not abide quarrelling with
anyone in the world.

_Yathāvādī kho āvuso sadevake loke samārake sabrahmake
sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya na kenaci loke vigayha
tiṭṭhati._
____

===== Norman's renderings

Norman regards _bhavābhava_ as 'rhythmical lengthening for _bhavabhava_ =
repeated existence, various existences,' and not as _bhava_ + _abhava_
(GD.n.496).

He translates it as:

- existences (Sn.v.776).

- different existences (Sn.v.786; Sn.v.801).

- various existences (Sn.v.877; Th.v.661).

- one existence after another (Sn.v.901).

- various kinds of existence (Sn.v.1060; Sn.v.1068).

In Sn.v.776 he treats _bhavesu_ and _bhavābhavesu_ as near synonyms:

- _bhavesu_: for existences

- _bhavābhavesu_: for various existences

===== PED's renderings

Duroiselle says the purpose of repetition is to express plurality, totality,
distribution, variety, multiplicity, etc (PGPL, Para.610). PED accordingly
renders _bhavābhava_ as 'this or that life, any form of existence, some sort
of existence.'

- _manosañcetanāhāro_: the existential nourishment of mental intentionality

==== Introduction

===== Existential nourishment

____
There are these four kinds of existential nourishment for the maintenance of
beings that have been brought into existence and for the assistance of those
about to arise [into new existence]

_Cattāro... āhārā bhūtānaṃ vā sattānaṃ ṭhitiyā sambhavesīnaṃ

****
_manosañcetanā tatiyā_
****

4. fourthly, the stream of sense consciousness
+
****
_viññāṇaṃ catutthaṃ_ (M.1.48).
****

Comment:

Norman views _sambhavesīnaṃ_ as the future active participle in -_esin_
(Elders Verses I, n.527), to be translated with the words 'about to.'

===== Manosañcetanāhāro: red-hot charcoal pit simile

The scriptures hardly clarify the meaning of _manosañcetanāhāro._ For
example, the _Puttamaṃsa Sutta_ says it can be compared to a man being
dragged reluctantly towards a red-hot charcoal pit, but it is not clear which
aspect of the simile is illustrative of _manosañcetanāhāro_. We therefore
look elsewhere for an explanation.

===== Sañcetanā: classification systems

_Sañcetanā_ is classified according to either objects or means, as follows:

1. intentionality concerning visible objects, audible objects, smellable
objects, tasteable objects, tangible objects, and mentally known objects
+
****
_rūpasañcetanā saddasañcetanā gandhasañcetanā rasasañcetanā
phoṭṭhabbasañcetanā dhammasañcetanā_ (D.2.309).
****

2. intentionality by way of body, speech, and mind
+
****
_kāyasañcetanā_, _vacīsañcetanā manosañcetanā_ (S.2.40).
****

The latter classification occurs in the following passage:

[quote, S.2.40]
____
When there is the body, then on account of bodily intentionality, pleasure and
pain arise for oneself;_

_Kāye vā hānanda sati kāyasañcetanāhetu uppajjati ajjhattaṃ
sukhadukkhaṃ_

When there is speech, then on account of verbal intentionality, pleasure and
pain arise for oneself;_

_vācāya vā hānanda sati vacīsañcetanāhetu uppajjati ajjhattaṃ
sukhadukkhaṃ_

When there is the mind, then on account of mental intentionality, pleasure and
pain arise for oneself -- and with uninsightfulness into reality as the
necessary condition.

_mane vā hānanda sati manosañcetanāhetu uppajjati ajjhattaṃ
sukhadukkhaṃ avijjāpaccayā ca._
____

===== Manosañcetanāhāro and taṇhā

The _Puttamaṃsa Sutta_ links mental intentionality to _taṇhā_, saying that:

[quote, S.2.100]
____
When the existential nourishment of mental intentionality is profoundly
understood, the three kinds of craving are profoundly understood.

_manosañcetanāya bhikkhave āhāre pariññāte tisso taṇhā pariññātā
honti._
____

Thus _manosañcetanā_ is somehow associated with _taṇhā._

===== Mental intentionality within taṇhā

_Taṇhā_ is practically an existential nourishment, because 'when a being has
laid down this [wretched human] body but is not yet possessed of another body,
I declare that it is fuelled by _taṇhā_.' The full quotation is given below

That _taṇhā_ implies mental intentionality is seen in the _Taṇhājālinī
Sutta_ (A.2.212-3) which says that thoughts of 'I am' are 'imbued with
_taṇhā'_ (_taṇhāvicaritāni_)_,_ for example, the thoughts "I am here,"
"I am this way" "I am otherwise." The sutta also lists thoughts which clearly
involve mental intentionality, namely:

- May I be

- May I be here

- May I be this way

- May I be otherwise.

===== Mental intentionality: Mahakaccānabhaddekaratta Sutta

Examples of mental intentionality are common in the scriptures. For example,
the _Mahakaccānabhaddekaratta Sutta_ says:

[quote, M.3.196]
____
How does one long for the future?

_Kathañcāvuso anāgataṃ paṭikaṅkhati_

One directs one's mind to acquire what has not yet been acquired, thinking,
'May the visual sense and visible objects be thus in the future.'

_iti me cakkhuṃ siyā anāgatamaddhānaṃ iti rūpāti appaṭiladdhassa
paṭilābhāya cittaṃ paṇidahati._
____

===== Mental intentionality and rebirth: the Cetanā Sutta

The four existential nourishments are 'for the assistance of those about to
arise [into new existence],' and are therefore the basis of rebirth. The
_Cetanā Sutta_ illustrates the link between mental intentionality and rebirth
as follows:

[quote, S.2.65]
____
Whatever one is intent upon, conceives of, and identifies with, this becomes
the basis for the establishment of one's stream of sense consciousness.

_yañca bhikkhave ceteti yañca pakappeti yañca anuseti ārammaṇametaṃ
hoti viññāṇassa ṭhitiyā_

When there is the basis, there is the establishment of one's stream of sense
consciousness.

_Yañca ārammaṇe sati patiṭṭhā viññāṇassa hoti._

When one's stream of sense consciousness is established and has [egoistically]
matured, renewed states of individual existence and rebirth occur in the future.

_Tasmiṃ patiṭṭhite viññāṇe virūḷhe āyatiṃ
punabbhavābhinibbatti hoti._
____

The sutta says that in ending intentness, conceiving, and identifying, one ends
individual existence and rebirth in the future:

[quote, S.2.65]
____
If one is not intent upon, and does not conceive or identify with... there are
no renewed states of individual existence and rebirth in the future

_Yato ca kho bhikkhave no ceva ceteti no ca pakappeti no ca anuseti...
āyatiṃ punabbhavābhinibbatti na hoti._
____

===== Mental intentionality and rebirth: the Saṅkhāruppatti Sutta

The _Saṅkhāruppatti Sutta_ says:

[quote, M.3.99 (A.4.239]
____
In this regard a bhikkhu possesses faith [in the perfection of the Perfect
One's transcendent insight], virtue, learning, generosity, and wisdom. He
thinks, 'Oh, that at the demise of the body at death, I might be reborn in the
company of wealthy _khattiyas_.' He fixes his mind on that idea, concentrates
on it, and develops it. These aspirations and musings of his, when developed
and cultivated, lead to his rebirth there.

_So taṃ cittaṃ dahati taṃ cittaṃ adhiṭṭhāti taṃ cittaṃ
bhāveti. Tassa te saṅkhārā ca viharā ca evaṃ bhāvitā
evaṃbahulīkatā tatrūpapattiyā saṃvattanti._
____

The scriptures therefore show how mental intentionality 'maintains beings that
have been brought into existence and assists those about to arise [into new
existence].' Therefore mental intentionality is one of the four nourishments,
and is likely the meaning of _manosañcetanāhāro_.

And how should the existential nourishment of mental intentionality
(_manosañcetanāhāro_) be seen?

_Kathañca bhikkhave manosañcetanāhāro daṭṭhabbo?_

Suppose there is a [red-hot] charcoal pit deeper than a man's height, filled
with glowing coals without flame or smoke. A man would come along wanting to
live, not die, yearning for pleasure and loathing pain. Then two strong men
would grab him by both arms and drag him towards the [red-hot] charcoal pit.

_Atha kho bhikkhave tassa purisassa ārakāvassa cetanā ārakā patthanā

pit and on that account I will meet with death or deadly pain.'

_manosañcetanāya ce bhikkhave āhāre atthi rāgo atthi nandi atthi taṇhā

_Yattha patiṭṭhitaṃ viññāṇaṃ virūḷhaṃ atthi tattha

Where there is the appearance of denomination-and-bodily-form, there is the
growth of karmically consequential deeds.

_Yattha atthi nāmarūpassa avakkanti atthi tattha saṅkhārānaṃ vuddhi._

Where there is the growth of karmically consequential deeds, renewed states of
individual existence and rebirth occur in the future.

There is the acquiring of a [particular] state of individuality in which one's

effect, not one's own; both; neither.

_atthāvuso attabhāvapaṭilābho yasmiṃ attabhāvapaṭilābhe_

Comment:

Venerable Sāriputta said this meant that where there is the acquiring of a
[particular] state of individuality in which one's own intentionality has
effect, not another person's, there is a passing away of beings from that group
on account of their own intentionality (_attasañcetanāhetu tesaṃ

other groups (A.2.159).

=== Maññati

==== Renderings

- _maññati_: to think

- _maññati_: to think appropriate

- _maññati_: to think of in personal terms

- _maññati_: to think 'I am'

- _maññita_: thinking in personal terms

==== Introduction

===== Think: rhetorical questions

As a rhetorical introduction to a question, the Buddha would ask what people
thought:

- 'What do you think, bhikkhus (_taṃ kiṃ maññatha bhikkhave_)? Is bodily
form lasting or unlasting?' (S.3.187).

- 'What do you think, bhikkhus (_taṃ kiṃ maññatha bhikkhave_)? Which is
the greater, this small stone I have picked up, the size of my hand, or the
Himalayas, the king of mountain ranges?' (M.3.166).

- What do you think, Kālāmas (_taṃ kiṃ maññatha kālāmā_)? Does greed
arise for one's benefit or harm? (A.1.189).

===== To think

_Maññati_ sometimes means 'to think':

[quote, Sn.v.840]
____
'I think such teaching is truly foolish'

_maññāmahaṃ momūhameva dhammaṃ._
____

[quote, Vin.2.203]
____
'Whoever might think he could pollute the sea with a pot of poison would not be
able to do so

_samuddaṃ visakumbhena yo maññeyya padūsituṃ._
____

[quote, M.2.2]
____
Groups of ascetics would sit quietly, hoping that the Buddha 'might think of
approaching'

_upasaṅkamitabbaṃ maññeyyā._
____

===== Think appropriate

_Maññati_ also means 'to think appropriate.' When the matted-hair ascetic
Kassapa of Uruvelā wanted to receive ordination, the Buddha told him to
consult his group of five hundred ascetics 'so that they can do what they think
appropriate' (_yathā te maññissanti tathā karissantī ti_).' That is,
whether or not to likewise receive ordination (Vin.1.32).

===== Think of in personal terms

_Maññati_ also means thinking of something in personal terms, or to 'think "I
am."' This is the special meaning of _maññati_. For example, a bhikkhu
'should not think "I am part of solidness"' (_paṭhaviyā mā maññi_). The
past participle _maññita_ is used as the corresponding noun. PED (sv
_Maññita_) calls it: 'illusion, imagination'). We say 'thinking in personal
terms':

[quote, S.4.22]
____
And what is the way that is appropriate for uprooting all thinking in
personal terms (_sabbamaññita_)? In this regard a bhikkhu does not think of
the visual sense in personal terms (_na maññati_), does not think (_na
maññati_) 'I am part of the visual sense,' does not think 'I am separate from
the visual sense,' does not think the visual sense is "[in reality] mine"

_Katamā ca sā bhikkhave sabbamaññitasamugghātasāruppapaṭipadā idha
bhikkhave bhikkhu cakkhuṃ na maññati cakkhusmiṃ na maññati cakkhuto na
maññati cakkhuṃ meti na maññati._
____

===== On resorting to brackets

Although translators agree to this special meaning of _maññati_, 'thinking in
personal terms,' they usually resort to brackets. For example, Horner says 'he
thinks (of self) in (regard to) extension' (Horner, MLS.1.4).

Bodhi, too, uses brackets, explaining that _maññati_ is often used to mean
'the intrusion of the egocentric perspective' (MLDB n.6). In translating the
_Mūlapariyāya Sutta_ he therefore introduces the word 'himself,' but in
brackets:

[quote, "Bodhi, M.1.1"]
____
'Having perceived earth as earth, he conceives [himself as] earth, he conceives
[himself] in earth, he conceives [himself apart] from earth, he conceives earth
to be 'mine.'

_paṭhaviṃ paṭhavito saññatvā paṭhaviṃ maññati paṭhaviyā
maññati paṭhavito maññati paṭhaviṃ me ti maññati._
____

Adding brackets tends to suggest that _maññati_ does not have the full
meaning one is giving it. We treat it as if it does.

Comment:

I render the locative case as 'part of,' and the ablative case as 'separate
from' for the following reasons:

1. The Locative shows the place in or on which a thing or person is, or an
action is done and is therefore expressed as in, on, upon, at (PGPL, para601).

2. The primary meaning of the Ablative is expressed by the word 'from,' namely
separation, and other relations in which the idea of separation is more or less
discernible (e.g. he fell from the horse) (PGPL, para 600).

===== Mantabhāṇī in the Bahubhāṇi Sutta

The meaning of _mantabhāṇī_ is suggested in the _Bahubhāṇi Sutta_, where
it is the opposite of _bahubhāṇī,_ as follows:

[quote, A.3.254]
____
Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers for a person in speaking profusely.
Which five?

_Pañcime bhikkhave ādīnavā bahubhāṇiyasmiṃ puggale. Katame pañca._

(...) He speaks falsely, maliciously, harshly, and frivolously; and with the
demise of the body at death, he is reborn in the plane of sub-human existence,
in the plane of misery, in the plane of damnation, or in hell.

_Musā bhaṇati. Pisunaṃ bhaṇati pharusaṃ bhaṇati samphappalāpaṃ

_Pañcime bhikkhave ānisaṃsā mantabhāṇismiṃ puggale. Katame pañca:_

(...) He does not speak falsely, maliciously, harshly, or frivolously; and with
the demise of the body at death, he is reborn in the realm of happiness, in the
heavenly worlds.

===== Mantabhāṇī in Dh.v.363

The meaning of _mantabhāṇī_ is suggested in Dh.v.363 where it is linked to
restraint in speech, and said to be ambrosial:

[quote, Dh.v.363]
____
Whatever bhikkhu is restrained in speech, whose speech is pithy, who is not
vain, who explains the meaning and significance [of the teaching], his speech
is ambrosial.

_Yo mukhasaṃyato bhikkhu mantabhāṇī anuddhato +
Atthaṃ dhammañca dīpeti madhuraṃ tassa bhāsitaṃ._
____

===== Mantabhāṇī in Sn.v.850

The meaning of _mantabhāṇī_ is suggested in Sn.v.850 where it is linked to
sagehood:

[quote, Sn.v.850]
____
A person who is not ill-tempered, not fearful, not boastful, not fretful, whose
speech is pithy, who is not vain, who is restrained in speech: he is truly a
sage.

_Akkodhano asantāsī avikatthī akukkucco +
Mantabhāṇī anuddhato sa ve vācāyato muni._
____

===== Mantabhāṇī and frivolous speech

If _mantabhāṇī_ is the opposite of profuse speech, then its qualities are
likely to be found with the abandonment of frivolous speech, which are seen in
the following quote:

[quote, A.5.205]
____
He abandons and abstains from frivolous speech, and speaks what is timely,
truthful and conducive to spiritual well-being. He speaks what accords with the
teaching and discipline. At the right time, he speaks what is worth treasuring,
congruous, appropriate, and conducive to spiritual well-being.

_samphappalāpaṃ pahāya samphappalāpā paṭivirato hoti kālavādī
bhūtavādī atthavādī dhammavādī vinayavādī nidhānavatiṃ vācaṃ
bhāsitā hoti kālena sāpadesaṃ pariyantavatiṃ atthasaṃhitaṃ._
____

'Words that are worth treasuring, congruous, appropriate, and conducive to
spiritual well-being' if associated with brevity in speech are all suggestive
of pithiness.

===== Pithy: definition and useage

Pithy means:

- 'Having substance and point; tersely cogent'

- 'Pithy' adds to 'succinct' or 'terse' the implication of richness of meaning
or substance (Webster's).

Pithiness is effective because:

- 'Men of talents are sooner to be convinced by short sentences than by long
preachments, because the short sentences drive themselves into the heart and
stay there, while long discourses, though ever so good, tire the attention; and
one good thing drives out another, and so on till all is forgotten.' (Clarissa
Harlowe by Samuel Richardson).

such as 'belonging to me' or 'associated with me' or 'connected with me.' It
can be rendered as either 'my' or 'mine.'

===== Rendering doctrinal contexts

But things that are conventionally mine are not [in reality] mine. We word
doctrinal contexts accordingly, for example by rendering _n'etaṃ mama_ as
'This is "not [in reality] mine."'

The parenthesis '[in reality]' is justified because of _mama_'s link to
_yathābhūtaṃ_:

[quote, S.4.1]
____
What is void of personal qualities should be seen according to reality with
perfect penetrative discernment as "not [in reality] mine," "not [in reality]
what I am," "not my [absolute] Selfhood"

_yadanattā taṃ n'etaṃ mama n'eso'hamasmi na me so attā ti evametaṃ
yathābhūtaṃ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṃ._
____

===== Inverted commas

Inverted commas are used in the way we have done because the Buddha would tell
bhikkhus to see things as 'not mine.' He obviously did not mean that their five
aggregates were not his, the Buddha's (_n'etaṃ mama_).

If an object either one's own or another's is "not [in reality] mine," then it
is not something that anyone, myself or another, could say is "[in reality]
mine." The reflection on _n'etaṃ mama_ thus embraces not just one's own
perspective on the world, but also one's insight into the perspective of others.

Comment:

The Uposatha Sutta says the particular application of this contemplation is in
personal relationships, where usually a man's parents know him as their son,
and he knows them as his parents:

****
_ayaṃ amhākaṃ putto ti so pi jānāti ime mayhaṃ mātāpitaro ti_.
****

Similarly, his slaves and servants know him as their master, and he knows them
as his slaves and servants:

****
_ayaṃ amhākaṃ ayyo ti. So pi jānāti ime mayhaṃ dāsakammakaraporisā ti._
****

The reflection therefore overcomes the idea that beings possess each other
(A.1.206).

- _mā anussavena_: Do not [accept and abide by religious teachings merely]

==== Introduction

===== Kālāma Sutta: for those without faith

The _Kālāma Sutta_ (A.1.188) answers this question: On what basis should
religious teachings be abandoned or accepted? The sutta is therefore aimed at
people lacking in established religious faith. It was preached twice by the
Buddha to such kinds of people, in the _Kālāma Sutta_ and the _Bhaddiya
Sutta_ (A.2.190). It was never preached to disciples with established faith,
and it was neither praised nor even mentioned by any of the bhikkhus when
speaking amongst themselves, showing that for those with established faith, the
_Kālāma Sutta_ is irrelevant. The _Sāḷha Sutta_ is an unusual sutta which
we will discuss separately.

===== For those with established faith: irrelevant

For those with established faith the _Kālāma Sutta_ is irrelevant because for
disciples with faith (_saddhassa sāvakassa_) it is in accordance with the
teaching (_anudhammo_) to reflect 'The Blessed One is the teacher, I am a
disciple. The Blessed One knows, I do not know' (_Jānāti bhagavā nāhaṃ
jānāmī ti_ M.1.480). For those with established faith, the _Kālāma Sutta_
is irrelevant, because considering whether the Buddha's teaching should be
abandoned or accepted implies a denial of one's faith in the Buddha as the
Teacher.

===== The Sāḷha Sutta

The _Sāḷha Sutta_ (A.1.194) describes an occasion when the _Kālāma Sutta_
was preached inappropriately. Firstly, the preacher was Venerable Nandaka,
foremost among exhorters of the bhikkhunīs (A.1.25). Sāḷha was the grandson
of Visākhā, not to be confused with Sāḷha the Licchavi who visited the
Buddha at Kūṭāgārasāla (see _Sāḷha Sutta_, A.2.200).

Why Nandaka preached the _Kālāma Sutta_ to Sāḷha is hard to fathom.
Sāḷha had asked no questions, and his visit to Nandaka was merely a social
call with his friend, Rohana. Not only was Sāḷha free of questions, later
events showed he was free of moral sensibility. This would in due course lead
him into taking an unhealthy interest in the bhikkhunīs, and on the pretext of
being their supporter, repeatedly attempting to seduce the beautiful bhikkhunī
Sundarīnandā, till eventually she became pregnant by him and disrobed
(Vin.4.211-6).

It can be no surprise, therefore, that the _Sāḷha Sutta_ has a rather
different conclusion to the _Bhaddiya_ and _Kālāma Suttas_. Whereas those
suttas had ended with listeners full of praise and thanks, in the _Sāḷha
Sutta_, while Venerable Nandaka waxed lyrical about exalted fruits of the
practice, from Sāḷha and Rohana we hear in appreciation not a word. Bhikkhu
Bodhi says that the advice of the _Kālāma Sutta_ 'can be dangerous if given
to those whose ethical sense is undeveloped.' In the _Sāḷha Sutta_ we have a
good example of what exactly that means.

===== Where the Kālāma Sutta is irrelevant

The _Kālāma Sutta_ is intended for those who have no established religious
faith, but who nonetheless, as Bodhi says, are 'of refined moral sensitivity.'
If this is misunderstood, problems arise. This is most obvious in people who
claim to be disciples of the Buddha but have no faith in him, and no shame of
wrongdoing, and who therefore easily gravitate to the philosophy of the
_Kālāma Sutta_. Two suttas show the result of this.

===== The Kīṭāgiri Sutta

In the _Kīṭāgiri Sutta_ (M.1.473) the bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka
refused the Buddha's request that they abandon the evening meal, because by
eating all day they claimed they were free of affliction and illness, and
enjoyed health, strength and a comfortable abiding. When bhikkhus tried to stop
them, they joked: 'Why should we abandon a benefit visible here and now to
pursue a benefit in the future?' This defence is reminiscent of the _Kālāma
Sutta_: 'If you yourselves should consider that this leads to benefit and
happiness, you should abide by it.' The Buddha summoned them, roundly
castigated them, and concluded:

[quote, M.1.480]
____
'Bhikkhus, you have lost your way. Bhikkhus, you are conducting yourselves
wrongly. Bhikkhus, how far you have strayed, you worthless men, from this
teaching and training system.'

_vippaṭipannā'ttha bhikkhave. Micchāpaṭipannā'ttha bhikkhave.
Kīvadūrevime bhikkhave moghapurisā apakkantā imasmā dhammavinayā._
____

This, then, is the result of applying the philosophy of the _Kālāma Sutta_,
when, as a disciple of the Buddha, one should already be established in faith.
As if to confirm the limitations of the _Kālāma Sutta_, the Buddha told the
bhikkhus to reflect that 'The Blessed One knows, I do not know.'

The _Kālāma Sutta_ says 'if you yourselves should consider these teachings
are blameworthy and denounced by the wise, you should abandon them.' The
admonishment of Assaji and Punabbasuka shows that in certain contexts, one
should apply this message to the _Kālāma Sutta_ itself.

===== The Bhaddāli Sutta

In the second situation, Venerable Bhaddali was another bhikkhu who was
apparently swayed by the philosophy of the _Kālāma Sutta_, again with
reference to avoiding the evening meal (_Bhaddāli Sutta_, M.1.437). Bhaddali's
excuse was 'I might become anxious and uneasy about it.' This is reminiscent of
the _Kālāma Sutta_'s advice: 'If you yourselves should consider these things
lead to harm and suffering you should abandon them.'

The Buddha criticised Bhaddali for not simply following the bhikkhu's code of
conduct as laid down, and said that the faith most bhikkhus had for the Buddha
was such that, if asked by him to 'be a plank for me across the mud' they would
simply obey. He said Bhaddali had no faith at all in the Buddha, and was
therefore not even a _saddhānusārī_. He was an empty, hollow wrongdoer
(_ritto tuccho aparaddho_).

This shows that the problem with following 'what one knows for oneself' lies in
the fact that religious practice is often uncomfortable, and the advice in the
_Kālāma Sutta_ to follow what one considers beneficial is rather easily
confused with following what one considers pleasant. Bhikkhu Bodhi calls it
'that egregious old tendency to interpret the Dhamma according to whatever
notions are congenial to oneself.'

It is pertinent to recall the words of the bhikkhu who said:

[quote, M.2.225]
____
'When I live as I please, spiritually unwholesome factors flourish, spiritually
wholesome factors fade. But when I apply myself to what is unpleasant,
spiritually unwholesome factors fade, spiritually wholesome factors flourish.
How about if I applied myself to what is unpleasant?'

_Puna ca paraṃ bhikkhave bhikkhu iti paṭisañcikkhati 'yathāsukhaṃ kho
me viharato akusalā dhammā abhivaḍḍhanti kusalā dhammā parihāyanti.
Dukkhāya pana me attānaṃ padahato akusalā dhammā parihāyanti kusalā
dhammā abhivaḍḍhanti. Yannūnāhaṃ dukkhāya attānaṃ padaheyyan ti._
____

===== Mā anussavena: what is the verb?

_Mā anussavena_ is commonly translated: 'Do not go by oral tradition.' The
verb 'go' is assumed because the verb is apparently missing. But the sentence
does indeed have a verb, because the sutta concerns the question, on what basis
should religious teachings be abandoned or accepted. The verbs 'abandon' and
'accept' occur when the Buddha tells the Kālāmas that under certain
circumstances this is what they should do (_atha tumhe kālāmā
pajaheyyātha... atha tumhe kālāmā upasampajja vihareyyātha_). These, then,
are the verbs to use instead of 'go.'

- _mā anussavena_: Do not [abandon religious teachings merely] because they
do not accord with an oral tradition.

- _mā anussavena_: Do not [accept and abide by religious teachings merely]
because they accord with an oral tradition.

===== Dhammā: teachings

Another problem with the _Kālāma Sutta_ is how to render _dhammā_ because it
has two fields of application. In one case, it means 'teachings,' and is
equivalent to _vādaṃ_ in the following passage, which we have divided into
Question and Answer:

*Question:*

____
-- There are some ascetics and Brahmanists, bhante, who visit Kesaputta. They
expound and explain only their own teachings (_sakaṃyeva vādaṃ_); the
teachings of others (_parappavādaṃ_) they despise, revile, and pull to
pieces. Some other ascetics and Brahmanists too, bhante, come to Kesaputta.
They also expound and explain only their own teachings; the teachings of others
they despise, revile, and pull to pieces.

_Te sakaṃyeva vādaṃ dīpenti jotenti parappavādaṃ pana khuṃsenti
vambhenti paribhavanti omakkhiṃ karonti_

(...) Bhante, there is unsureness, there is doubt in us concerning them. Which of
these reverend ascetics and Brahmanists spoke the truth and which falsehood?"

_Tesaṃ no bhante amhākaṃ hoteva kaṅkhā hoti vicikicchā. Ko su nāma
imesaṃ bhavataṃ samaṇabrāhmaṇānaṃ saccaṃ āha ko musā ti?_
____

*Answer:*

[quote, A.1.189]
____
-- Kālāmas, if you yourselves should consider:

_Yadā tumhe kālāmā attanāva jāneyyātha_

(...) These teachings (_dhammā_) are unwholesome;

_ime dhammā akusalā_

(...) these teachings are blameworthy;

_ime dhammā sāvajjā_

(...) these teachings are denounced by the wise;

_ime dhammā viññugarahitā_

(...) when followed and taken up

_ime dhammā samattā samādinnā_

(...) these teachings lead to harm and suffering,"

_ahitāya dukkhāya saṃvattantīti_

(...) you should abandon them.

_atha tumhe kālāmā pajaheyyātha._
____

===== Dhammā: six phenomena

In the other case, _dhammā_ is used in reference to six phenomena: greed,
hatred, and undiscernment of reality (_lobho doso moho_) and their opposites,
non-greed, non-hatred, and discernment of reality (_alobho adoso amoho_). The
sutta calls these phenomena _dhammā_ which we render as 'factors.'

[quote, A.1.189-191]
____
-- 'What do you think, Kālāmas? Are these factors spiritually wholesome, or
spiritually unwholesome?'

_Taṃ kiṃ maññatha kālāmā ime dhammā kusalā vā akusalā vā ti?_

-- 'Spiritually unwholesome, bhante.'

_Akusalā bhante._
____

===== Two lists of reasons

Another problem with the _Kālāma Sutta_ is that there are two lists:

1. ten reasons for not abandoning teachings, and

2. ten reasons for not accepting teachings

But the two lists are identical, where it would make more sense if they were
not. For example, _mā anussavena_ means teachings should not be abandoned or
accepted merely because of their relationship to an oral tradition. But this
would be clearer if _mā anussavena_ was phrased either positively or
negatively, as follows:

- Do not [abandon religious teachings merely] because they do not accord with
an oral tradition.

- Do not [accept and abide by religious teachings merely] because they accord
with an oral tradition.

We say 'merely because' because the _Kālāma Sutta_ is not about _whether_
teachings should be abandoned or accepted, but on what basis and for what
reason this should happen. By all means, abandon teachings, but not merely
because they do not accord with an oral tradition etc.

===== If you yourselves should consider: yadā attanāva jāneyyātha

We deal with this issue elsewhere, sv _Jāneyyāti_, where we note that the
prominent phrase in the sutta is often translated by ignoring the optative
tense, saying:

[quote, A.1.190]
____
When you know for yourselves: 'These things are unwholesome... then you should
abandon them.

_Yadā tumhe kālāmā attanāva jāneyyātha ime dhammā akusalā... atha
tumhe kālāmā pajaheyyātha._
____

But to propose that the Buddha is saying an untrained disciple could really
know for himself what things are unwholesome would negate the rationale for a
religious training system. We suggest that this excerpt is more accurately and
more rationally translated with 'should consider.' The context obliges one to
translate _yadā_ as 'if' not 'when':

[quote, A.1.190]
____
Kālāmas, if you yourselves should consider: "These teachings are
unwholesome... you should abandon them.

_Yadā tumhe kālāmā attanāva jāneyyātha ime dhammā akusalā... atha
tumhe kālāmā pajaheyyātha._
____

For further notes, see sv _Jāneyyāti._

===== The Buddha's attitude to self-reliance

To what degree the Buddha expected self-reliance from his disciples is obvious
in these two quotes:

1. So long as in relation to spiritually wholesome factors, [what should be
done] by a bhikkhu is not done, neither with the help of faith [in the
perfection of the Buddha's transcendent insight], nor with the help of shame of
wrongdoing, nor with the help of fear of wrongdoing, nor with the help of
energetic application [to the practice], nor with the help of wisdom, that
bhikkhu should be looked after by me.

_Evameva kho bhikkhave yāvakīvañca bhikkhuno saddhāya akataṃ hoti
kusalesu dhammesu hiriyā akataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu ottappena akataṃ

****

[quote, A.3.6]
____
But when [what should be done] by a bhikkhu is done, either with the help of
faith [in the perfection of the Buddha's transcendent insight], or with the
help of shame of wrongdoing, or with the help of fear of wrongdoing, or with
the help of energetic application [to the practice], or with the help of
wisdom, I am unconcerned about him, thinking: 'The bhikkhu can now look after
himself. He will not be negligently applied [to the practice].'

_Yato ca kho bhikkhave bhikkhuno saddhāya kataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu
hiriyā kataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu ottappena kataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu
viriyena kataṃ hoti kusalesu dhammesu paññāya kataṃ hoti kusalesu
dhammesu anapekkho dānāhaṃ bhikkhave tasmiṃ bhikkhusmiṃ homi
Attaguttodāni bhikkhu nālaṃ pamādāyā ti._
____

2. Therefore, Ānanda, dwell spiritually self-reliant, with yourself as your
refuge, with no other refuge, relying completely on the teaching, with the
teaching as your refuge, with no other refuge. How do you do this?
+
****
_Tasmātihānanda attadīpā viharatha attasaraṇā anaññasaraṇā
dhammadīpā dhammasaraṇā anaññasaraṇā. Kathañcānanda bhikkhu
attadīpo viharati attasaraṇo anaññasaraṇo dhammadīpo dhammasaraṇo
anaññasaraṇo:_
****

[quote, S.5.154]
____
(...) In this regard a bhikkhu abides contemplating the nature of the body,
vigorously, fully consciously, and mindfully, having eliminated greed and
dejection in regard to the world [of phenomena].

_idhānanda bhikkhu kāye kāyānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā
vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ._

(...) He abides contemplating the nature of sense impressions... the nature of
the mind... the nature of certain objects of the systematic teachings

_Vedanāsu vedanānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke
abhijjhādomanassaṃ. Citte cittānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno
satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ. Dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati
ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ._

(...) Thus a bhikkhu abides spiritually self-reliant, with himself as his refuge,
with no other refuge, relying completely on the teaching, with the teaching as
his refuge, with no other refuge.

_Evaṃ kho ānanda bhikkhu attadīpo viharati attasaraṇo anaññasaraṇo
dhammadīpo dhammasaraṇo anaññasaraṇo_

(...) Those bhikkhus, either now or after my passing, who abide spiritually
self-reliant, with themselves as their refuge, with no other refuge; relying
completely on the teaching, with the teaching as their refuge, with no other
refuge; it is these bhikkhus, Ānanda, who will be for me foremost amongst
those desirous of the training.

_Ye hi keci ānanda etarahi vā mamaccaye vā attadīpā viharissanti
attasaraṇā anaññasaraṇā dhammasaraṇā anaññasaraṇā tamatagge me
te ānanda bhikkhu bhavissanti ye keci sikkhākāmāti._

===== Conceit: abandoned at non-returnership

Non-returners have abandoned conceit (_māna_):

[quote, It.3]
____
Abandon one thing, bhikkhus, conceit, and I guarantee you non-returnership.

_Mānaṃ bhikkhave ekadhammaṃ pajahatha ahaṃ vo pāṭibhogo

Non-returners have not abandoned self-centredness (_māna_ or _asmimāna_):

- Friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five ties to
individual existence in the low plane of existence (_pañcorambhāgiyāni
saṃyojanāni_), still, in regard to the five grasped aggregates, there
remains within him (_hotiyeva_) a residual self-centredness (_anusahagato asmī
ti māno_) (S.3.130).

Self-centredness is sometimes discriminated from conceit by being called
_asmimāna_ or _asmī ti māno._

Self-centredness implies the notion "I am":

[quote, S.4.202-3]
____
The notion "I am" is... an acquiescence in self-centredness.

_Asmī ti... mānagatametaṃ._
____

Here _asmī ti_ is equated with _mānagatametaṃ_. This shows that _asmimāno_
is a compound of two equivalent terms, and that _asmimāno_ means simply
_māno._

===== Vidhā means mānavidhā

Self-centredness (_māna_) has three modes (_tisso vidhā_). This is proven by
comparing the _Vidhā Sutta_ (S.5.56) and _Theragāthā_ verse 428. What the
former calls _vidhā_, the latter calls _mānavidhā._

The _Vidhā Sutta_ says there are three modes [of self-centredness] (_tisso
vidhā_), namely:

[quote, S.5.56]
____
'I am better' mode [of self-centredness]

_seyyo'hamasmī ti vidhā_

'I am equal' mode [of self-centredness]

_sadiso'hamasmī ti vidhā_

'I am worse' mode [of self-centredness]

_hīno'hamasmī ti vidhā._
____

_Theragāthā_ verse 428 says:

[quote, Th.v.428]
____
Self-conceit and self-contempt have been abandoned and completely abolished [by
me].

_Atimāno ca omāno pahīnā susamūhatā_

Self-equation has been eradicated. All modes of self-centredness have been
struck down.

_Asmimāno samucchinno sabbe mānavidhā hatā ti._
____

In comparing the two quotes, we can say:

In _Theragāthā_ verse 428, _mānavidhā_ consists of

1. _atimāno_

2. _omāno_

3. _asmimāno_

In the _Vidhā Sutta_, _tisso vidhā_ consists of three corresponding elements:

1. _seyyo'hamasmī_

2. _hīno'hamasmī_

3. _sadiso'hamasmī_

This shows that:

1. _Vidhā_ is an abbreviation for _mānavidhā_. Therefore _vidhā_ means
'modes [of self-centredness]' not just 'modes' (as PED).

2. 'I am better' mode [of self-centredness] (_seyyo'hamasmī ti_) equals
'self-conceit' (_atimāno_)

3. 'I am worse' mode [of self-centredness] (_hīno'hamasmī ti_) equals
'self-contempt' (_omāno_)

4. 'I am equal' mode [of self-centredness] (_sadiso'hamasmī ti_) equals
'self-equation' (_asmimāno_).

Equation is 'the act of regarding as equal' (WordWeb).

=== Muditā

==== Renderings

- _muditā_: [unlimited, all-encompassing] joy

==== Introduction

===== Unlimitedness

The practices of _mettā_, _karuṇā_, _muditā_ and _upekkhā_ are sometimes
called the four divine abidings (_cattāro brahmavihārā_, D.2.196) and
sometimes the four unlimited states (_catasso appamaññā_, D.3.223).
Practising them together is called the 'unlimited liberation [from perceptually
obscuring states]' (_appamāṇā cetovimutti_, S.4.296). The _Mahāvedalla
Sutta_ (M.1.298) and _Godatta Sutta_ (S.4.296) say the 'makers of limitation'
(_pamāṇakaraṇo_) are _rāgo doso_ and _moho_ (_rāgo kho āvuso
pamāṇakaraṇo doso pamāṇakaraṇo moho pamāṇakaraṇo_). Therefore
the four _brahmavihāras_ should be practised unlimited by _rāgo doso_ and
_moho_.

===== Parisā Sutta: muditā brahmavihāra

____
The _Parisā Sutta_ (A.1.243) shows that _muditā_ is a joy associated with
living in harmony with others. It says that in whatever community the bhikkhus
dwell together in unity, on friendly terms, without quarrelling, like milk and
water mixed, viewing each other with affection, such a community is called
united.

_Idha bhikkhave yassaṃ parisāyaṃ bhikkhū samaggā sammodamānā
avivadamānā khīrodakībhūtā aññamaññaṃ piyacakkhūhi sampassantā
viharanti. Ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave samaggā parisā._

The sutta says when bhikkhus dwell like this, they beget much merit.

_Yasmiṃ bhikkhave samaye bhikkhū samaggā sammodamānā avivadamānā
khīrodakībhūtā aññamaññaṃ piyacakkhūhi sampassantā viharanti
bahuṃ bhikkhave bhikkhū tasmiṃ samaye puññaṃ pasavanti._

At such time they dwell in a divine abiding, that is to say, in the liberation
[from perceptually obscuring states] through _muditā_ (_muditāya
cetovimuttiyā_).

_Brahmaṃ bhikkhave vihāraṃ tasmiṃ samaye bhikkhū viharanti yadidaṃ
muditāya cetovimuttiyā._
____

The sutta says that in one who is glad, rapture arises (_pamuditassa pīti
jāyati_). The sutta therefore treats _muditā_ and gladness (_pamudita_) as
synonyms (i.e. ..._yadidaṃ muditāya cetovimuttiyā. Pamuditassa pīti
jāyati..._).

_Pamuditassa_ more usually follows _pāmojjaṃ._ For example, when a bhikkhu
realises the five hindrances have been abandoned within him, 'gladness arises.
In one who is glad, rapture arises': _tassime pañca nīvaraṇe pahīṇe
attani samanupassato pāmojjaṃ jāyati. Pamuditassa pīti jāyati_ (D.1.204).
This suggests that _muditā_ is close in meaning to _pāmojjaṃ_ gladness.

The phrases 'on friendly terms, without quarrelling, like milk and water mixed,
viewing each other with affection' support _muditā_ being rendered
'[unlimited, all-encompassing] joy.' This is confirmed in the _Cūḷagosiṅga
Sutta_.

===== The Cūḷagosiṅga Sutta

Venerable Anuruddha, living with Venerables Nandiya and Kimbila, was asked by
the Buddha:

____
-- But, Anuruddha, how do you abide in unity, on friendly terms, without
quarrelling, like milk and water mixed, viewing each other with affection?

_Yathākathaṃ pana tumhe anuruddhā samaggā sammodamānā avivadamānā

This again supports _muditā_ being rendered as '[unlimited, all-encompassing]
joy,' i.e. joy unlimited by _rāgo doso_ and _moho._

===== Arati: disgruntlement [with the celibate life]

The _Dasuttara Sutta_ says disgruntlement [with the celibate life] can be
overcome by [unlimited, all-encompassing] joy:

[quote, D.3.249]
____
For this is the liberation from disgruntlement [with the celibate life] namely
the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through [unlimited,
all-encompassing] joy.

_nissaraṇaṃ hetaṃ āvuso aratiyā yadidaṃ muditā cetovimuttī ti._

The sutta says if the practice of [unlimited, all-encompassing] joy is
developed and cultivated, it is impossible, out of the question, that
disgruntlement [with the celibate life] would plague one's mind. There is no
such possibility.

_arati cittaṃ pariyādāya ṭhassati netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati._
____

===== Overcoming disgruntlement: Saṅkhadhama Sutta

The _Saṅkhadhama Sutta_ describes in more detail the practice of _muditā_:

[quote, S.4.322]
____
The noble disciple abides pervading one quarter with a mind of [unlimited,
all-encompassing] joy, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the
fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, in all directions, everywhere, he
abides pervading the whole world [of beings] with a mind of [unlimited,
all-encompassing] joy, vast, exalted, unlimited, free of unfriendliness and
hostility.

_muditāsahagatena cetasā ekaṃ disaṃ pharitvā viharati tathā dutiyaṃ
tathā tatiyaṃ tathā catutthiṃ; iti uddhamadhotiriyaṃ sabbadhi
sabbatthatāya sabbāvantaṃ lokaṃ muditāsahagatena cetasā vipulena
mahaggatena appamāṇena averena avyāpajjhena pharitvā viharati._
____

This meditation can be practised in either a quiet room or deep solitude. For
example, King Mahāsudassana practised _muditā_ in his golden-gabled chamber
sitting on a silver couch (D.2.188). The Buddha practised it in a quiet grove
sitting on a bundle of grass (A.1.183). Thus although the _Parisā Sutta_ says
_muditā_ arises where the bhikkhus dwell together in unity, it does not mean
that the formal practice of _muditā_ involves the company of others.

===== Muditā: cure for envy?

The _Visuddhimagga_ says the function of _muditā_ 'resides in being unenvious'
(Chapter 9, paragraph 95) and 'is always in the sense of gladness at others'
success' (p.309 n.10). But if _muditā_ meant unenviousness, it would surely
have featured in the cure of odious envy (_pāpikā issā_) expounded in the
_Kāya Sutta_ (A.5.40) which says when an envious person sees a fortunate
layperson or bhikkhu, he is envious about it:

- 'Oh that this grain, silver and gold did not belong to this householder!'

- 'Oh that this Venerable did not receive a good supply of requisites.'

The sutta says envy is abandoned not through _muditā_ but through seeing envy
over and over again with discernment (_paññāya disvā disvā pahātabbā_).

If envy can be considered part of aversion (_āghāto_), then again _muditā_
is not for overcoming envy, says the _Āghātapaṭivinaya Sutta_ (A.3.185),
saying that three ways of dispelling aversion involve developing _mettā_,
_karuṇā_, and _upekkhā_, but not _muditā_: _Yasmiṃ bhikkhave puggale
āghāto jāyetha mettā... karuṇā... upekkhā tasmiṃ puggale
bhāvetabbā_ (A.3.185).

===== Cultivating pāmojjaṃ gladness

We said above that _muditā_ is close in meaning to _pāmojjaṃ_. Therefore we
might understand how to develop it by examining _pāmojjaṃ_.

1. Gladness (_pāmojjaṃ_) is associated with virtuous conduct. For one who is
virtuous (_sīlavato_) there is no need to harbour the aspiration: 'May freedom
from an uneasy conscience (_avippaṭisāro_) arise in me. It is quite natural
that this should happen (_dhammatā esā bhikkhave yaṃ sīlavato
sīlasampannassa avippaṭisāro uppajjati_). For one free from an uneasy
conscience, there is no need to harbour the aspiration: 'May gladness arise in
me.' It is quite natural that this should happen (A.5.2).

2. Gladness is associated with physical seclusion (_divā pavivekāya rattiṃ
paṭisallānāya_). Abiding thus diligently, gladness arises (_evaṃ
appamattassa viharato pāmujjaṃ jāyati_, S.5.398).

3. Gladness is associated with faith inspiring meditation objects (_tassa
kismiñcideva pasādaniye nimitte cittaṃ paṇidahato pāmujjaṃ jāyati_,
S.5.156). This means reflecting on the Buddha, the teaching, the community of
disciples, one's own virtue, and on how one has the virtuous qualities of the
devas. As one reflects like this, one's mind becomes serene and gladness arises
(_cittaṃ pasīdati pāmujjaṃ uppajjati_ A.1.207).

4. Gladness is associated with abandoning the five hindrances. Seeing that the
five hindrances are abandoned, one becomes glad (_pāmojjaṃ jāyati_); glad,
rapture arises (_pamuditassa pīti jāyati_ D.1.74).

5. Gladness is associated with righteous conversations (_labhati ca
tatonidānaṃ pītipāmujjaṃ_): conversations on faith [in the perfection of
the Perfect One's transcendent insight], virtue, learning, generosity, and
wisdom (_saddhākathā sīlakathā bāhusaccakathā cāgakathā
paññākathā_, A.3.181).

6. Gladness is associated with grasping the meaning and truth of the teaching
_dhamme atthappaṭisaṃvedī ca hoti dhammapaṭisaṃvedī ca_. This gives
rise to gladness (_pāmujjaṃ jāyati_) This can happen either in the process of
+
- being taught by a teacher: _satthā dhammaṃ deseti_
- teaching others: _paresaṃ deseti_
- reciting the teaching: _sajjhāyaṃ karoti_
- pondering the teaching: _anuvitakketi anuvicāreti manasānupekkhati_
- contempating a meditation object: _samādhinimittaṃ_ (A.3.21).

===== Six principles of cordiality: dhammā sārāṇīyā

Cultivating _muditā_ likely involves the six principles of cordiality, because
they are the key to harmonious relationships: _chayime bhikkhave dhammā
sārāṇīyā piyakaraṇā garukaraṇā saṅgahāya avivādāya
sāmāggiyā ekībhāvāya saṃvattanti_ (M.1.322).

These principles are:

____
(1-3) Maintaining loving conduct of body, speech, and mind, both openly and
privately towards one's companions in the religious life.

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhuno mettaṃ kāyakammaṃ... vacīkammaṃ...
manokammaṃ paccupaṭṭhitaṃ hoti sabrahmacārīsu āvī ceva raho ca._
____

(4) Sharing one's gains with one's virtuous companions in the religious life
without reservation, including even the contents one's almsbowl.

****
_Puna ca paraṃ bhikkhave bhikkhu ye te lābhā dhammikā dhammaladdhā
antamaso pattapariyāpannamattampi tathārūpehi lābhehi
appaṭivibhattabhogī hoti sīlavantehi sabrahmacārīhi sādhāraṇa bhogī._
****

(5) Maintaining virtues that are pure and conducive to inward collectedness both
openly and privately together with one's companions in the religious life.

****
_Puna ca paraṃ bhikkhave bhikkhu yāni tāni sīlāni akhaṇḍāni
acchiddāni asabalāni akammāsāni bhujissāni viññuppasatthāni
aparāmaṭṭhāni samādhisaṃvattanikāni tathārūpesu sīlesu
sīlasāmaññagato viharati sabrahmacārīhi āvī ceva raho ca._
****

(6) But the chief, the most cohesive, the most unifying of these principles is
[having a shared] view that is noble, and which leads to deliverance [from
suffering], and which leads the one who practises it to the complete
destruction of suffering.'

****
_Imesaṃ kho bhikkhave channaṃ sārāṇīyānaṃ dhammānaṃ etaṃ
aggaṃ etaṃ saṅgāhikaṃ etaṃ saṅghātanikaṃ yadidaṃ yāyaṃ
diṭṭhi ariyā niyyātikā niyyāti takkarassa sammā dukkhakkhayāya_
(M.1.322).
****

We parenthesise '[having a shared]' because the sutta affirms this previously,
by saying that:

[quote, M.1.322]
____
Whatever view is noble, and which leads to deliverance [from suffering], and
which leads the one who practises it to the complete destruction of suffering,
a bhikkhu abides united in a view such as this with his companions in the
religious life, both in public and in private

_bhikkhu yāyaṃ diṭṭhi ariyā niyyānikā niyyāti takkarassa sammā
dukkhakkhayāya tathārūpāya diṭṭhiyā diṭṭhisāmaññagato viharati
sabrahmacārīhi āvī ceva raho ca._
____

===== Limits of muditā

The _Saṅkhadhama Sutta_ says the essential practice of _muditā_ involves
pervading the whole world [of beings] with a mind of [unlimited,
all-encompassing] joy. But [unlimited, all-encompassing] joy does not mean
unconditionally [unlimited, all-encompassing] joy because the scriptures say
that establishing community harmony involves firstly excluding troublesome
individuals. The _Dhammacariya Sutta_ says:

[quote, Sn.v.282-283]
____
Then winnow the chaff, those who are not ascetics but consider themselves so.
Having banished those of unvirtuous desires, conduct, and sphere of personal
application, live in unity, mindfully, the pure with the pure. Thus living in
unity, being mindful, you will put an end to suffering.

_Tato palāpe vāhetha assamaṇe samaṇamānine +
Niddhamitvāna pāpicche pāpaācāragocare +
Suddhā suddhehi saṃvāsaṃ kappayavho patissatā +
Tato samaggā nipakā dukkhassantaṃ karissathā ti._
____

[quote, M.1.206]
____
Secondly, one needs a zealous gatekeeper. When the three arahants, Venerables
Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were living together in the Gosinga Sāla-tree
Wood, their utmost harmony was shielded by a zealous gatekeeper who so
diligently defended the place against visitors, that when on one occasion the
Buddha dared enter uninvited, he was swiftly rebuked: 'Do not enter this grove,
ascetic! There are three noble young men here seeking their Soul. Do not
disturb them!'

_mā samaṇa etaṃ dāyaṃ pāvisi sant'ettha tayo kulaputtā
attakāmarūpā viharanti mā tesaṃ aphāsumakāsī ti._
____

===== The problem with muditā

The _Parisā Sutta_ alludes to a potential problem with _muditā_ by suggesting
that [unlimited, all-encompassing] joy may mean less time for solitude and
meditation. It says the 'assembly that is foremost' (_aggavatī parisā_) is
better than a 'harmonious assembly' (_samaggā parisā_) because it is
dedicated to solitude and to applying energy for the sake of spiritual
attainment (_paviveke pubbaṅgamā viriyaṃ ārabhanti appattassa pattiyā_
(A.1.243).

===== Comparing muditā with mettā and karuṇā

The fragility of _muditā_ is not seen in _mettā_ and _karuṇā_, which
remain operational under great stress:

[quote, M.1.129]
____
Bhikkhus, even if thugs should sever your limbs one by one with a two-handled
saw, he whose mind was thereby filled with hatred would not on that account be
a practiser of my training system.

_Ubhatodaṇḍakena pi ce bhikkhave kakacena corā ocarakā aṅgamaṅgāni
okanteyyuṃ tatrāpi yo mano padūseyya na me so tena sāsanakaro._

(...) In this regard, you should train yourselves thus: 'Neither shall our minds
be worsened by this, nor shall we utter unvirtuous words, but we shall abide
tenderly concerned for their welfare, with a mind of [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill, without inner hatred.'_

_Tatrāpi vo bhikkhave evaṃ sikkhitabbaṃ: na ceva no cittaṃ
vipariṇataṃ bhavissati. Na ca pāpakaṃ vācaṃ nicchāressāma.
Hitānukampī ca viharissāma mettacittā na dosantarā._
____

The practice of _muditā_ seems more successful where incompatible individuals
live apart. _Mettā_ may be strengthened where they live together. But
_muditā_ is nonetheless an ego-dissolving exercise in which one can live with
others like milk and water, and allows one to joyously overlook or endure their
idiosyncracies.

Now at such time as the bhikkhus dwell in unity, on friendly terms, without

"'A carbuncle,' bhikkhus, is a metaphor for this [wretched human] body made of

demolished.

- _metta_: lovingly

==== Introduction

===== Four unlimited states

The practices of _mettā_, _karuṇā_, _muditā_ and _upekkhā_ are sometimes
called the four divine abidings (_cattāro brahmavihārā_, D.2.196) and
sometimes the four unlimited states (_catasso appamaññā_, D.3.223).
Practising them together is called the 'unlimited liberation [from perceptually
obscuring states]' (_appamāṇā cetovimutti_, S.4.296).

===== The makers of limitation

The _Mahāvedalla Sutta_ (M.1.298) and _Godatta Sutta_ (S.4.296) say the
'makers of limitation' (_pamāṇakaraṇo_) are _rāgo doso_ and _moho_
(_rāgo kho āvuso pamāṇakaraṇo doso pamāṇakaraṇo moho
pamāṇakaraṇo_). Therefore the four _brahmavihāras_ should be practised
unlimited by _rāgo doso_ and _moho_.

===== Loving-kindness

_Mettā_ is usually called loving-kindness, which means 'tender and benevolent
affection,' says Webster's. But if affection means fondness and attachment, it
is not an attitude to be developed at all, say the suttas:

[quote, M.1.191]
____
Whatever within these five grasped aggregates is the elimination and rejection
of fondness and attachment is the ending of suffering.

_Yo imesu pañcasupādānakkhandhesu chandarāgavinayo chandarāgappahānaṃ
so dukkhanirodho ti._
____

Ṭhānissaro says:

- 'There are probably people you've harmed in the past who would rather not
have anything to do with you ever again, so the intimacy of loving-kindness
would actually be a source of pain for them, rather than joy. There are also
people who, when they see that you want to express loving-kindness, would be
quick to take advantage of it. And there are plenty of animals out there who
would feel threatened by any overt expressions of love from a human being. In
these cases, a more distant sense of goodwill, that you promise yourself never
to harm those people or those beings, would be better for everyone involved.'
(_Mettā Means Goodwill_: www. accesstoinsight.org).

===== Mettā overcomes resentment, hatred, and ill will

Mettā is for overcoming resentment, hatred, and ill will:

1. When resentment has arisen for someone, one can develop [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill for him. Thus can one dispel aversion for that
person.

_Yasmiṃ bhikkhave puggale āghāto jāyetha mettā tasmiṃ puggale
bhāvetabbā. Evaṃ tasmiṃ puggale āghāto paṭivinetabbo_ (A.3.185).

2. To abandon hatred, [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill should be
developed.
+
****
Dosassa pahānāya mettā bhāvetabbā_ (A.3.446).
****

3. I do not see any other single thing of such power to prevent the arising of
ill will, if not already arisen, or, if arisen, to cause its abandonment, as
the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill.

****

===== Benefits of mettā

Mettā leads 1) to 'the Exquisite' (i.e. fourth jhāna. See IGPT sv _Subha_),
and 2) to non-returnership:

1. Bhikkhus, the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through
[unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill has the Exquisite as its culmination, I
declare, for a wise bhikkhu here who has not penetrated to a superior
liberation.
+
****
_Subhaparamāhaṃ bhikkhave mettā cetovimuttiṃ vadāmi idha paññassa
bhikkhuno uttariṃ vimuttiṃ appaṭivijjhato_ (S.5.119).

2. Thus developed, the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through
[unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill leads to non-returnership for a wise
bhikkhu here who has not penetrated to a more exalted liberation.

===== Arousing faith with mettā

The Buddha suffused others with [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill
(_mettena cittena pharati_) to arouse faith in them. Two examples:

1. 'It would not be hard, Ānanda, for the Perfect One to arouse faith in this
teaching and training system in Roja the Malla.' Then the Blessed One, having
suffused Roja the Malla with a mind of [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill
rising from his seat, entered his dwelling. Then Roja the Malla, suffused by
the Blessed One with a mind of [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill, even as
young calves follow their mothers, having approached dwelling after dwelling,
compound after compound, asked the bhikkhus: 'Where, bhante, is the Blessed One
staying just now, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One? For I long to see
the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One'.
+
****
_Na kho taṃ ānanda dukkaraṃ tathāgatena yathā rojo mallo imasmiṃ
dhammavinaye pasīdeyyā ti. Atha kho bhagavā rojaṃ mallaṃ mettena cittena

mettena cittena phuṭṭho seyyathā pi nāma gāvī taruṇavacchā, evameva
vihārena vihāraṃ pariveṇena pariveṇaṃ upasaṅkamitvā bhikkhū
pucchati: kahannu kho bhante etarahi so bhagavā viharati arahaṃ sammā
sambuddho? Dassanakāmā hi mayaṃ taṃ bhagavantaṃ arahantaṃ
sammāsambuddhan ti_ (Vin.1.247).
****

2. 'Bhante, this elephant Nālāgiri approaching on this carriage road is an
uncontrollable mankiller. Bhante, may the Blessed One turn back, may the
Sublime One turn back.'... Then the Blessed One suffused the elephant
Nālāgiri with a mind of [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill. Then the
elephant Nālāgiri, suffused by the Blessed One with a mind of [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill, lowered his trunk, approached the Blessed One, and
stood in front of him...And so it was in this way that the elephant Nālāgiri
became tamed.
+
****
_ayaṃ bhante nālāgiri hatthi caṇḍo manussaghātako imaṃ racchaṃ

===== Mettā and unlimitedness

The unlimitedness of _mettā_ (i.e. _mettā_ unlimited by _rāgo doso_ and
_moho_) is seen in this quote:

[quote, M.1.129]
____
Bhikkhus, even if thugs should sever your limbs one by one with a two-handled
saw, he whose mind was thereby filled with hatred would not on that account be
a practiser of my training system.

_Ubhatodaṇḍakena pi ce bhikkhave kakacena corā ocarakā aṅgamaṅgāni
okanteyyuṃ tatrāpi yo mano padūseyya na me so tena sāsanakaro._

(...) In this regard, you should train yourselves thus: 'Neither shall our minds
be worsened by this, nor shall we utter unvirtuous words, but we shall abide
tenderly concerned for their welfare, with a mind of [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill, without inner hatred.'_

_Tatrāpi vo bhikkhave evaṃ sikkhitabbaṃ: na ceva no cittaṃ
vipariṇataṃ bhavissati. Na ca pāpakaṃ vācaṃ nicchāressāma.
Hitānukampī ca viharissāma mettacittā na dosantarā._
____

===== Sabbatthatāya not sabbattatāya

_Sabbatthatāya_ is a long-standing issue in the scriptures because of its
alternative spelling, _sabbattatāya,_ which Bodhi renders as 'to all as to
himself,' as follows:

[quote, "Bodhi, M.1.38"]
____
(...) everywhere, and to all as to himself, he abides pervading the
all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness

_sabbadhi sabbatthatāya sabbāvantaṃ lokaṃ mettāsahagatena cetasā...
pharitvā viharati._
____

Horner translates it as 'in every way':

- he dwells having suffused the whole world everywhere, in every way, with a
mind of friendliness (Horner, M.1.38).

The phrase _sabbadhi sabbatthatāya_ also occurs at Ud.33 where the phrase 'to
all as to himself' (_sabbattatāya_) is clearly inappropriate:

[quote, Ud.33]
____
Whatever states of individual existence there are in any way, anywhere ('to all
as to himself'), all these states of individual existence are unlasting

_ye hi keci bhavā sabbadhi sabbatthatāya sabbe te bhavā aniccā._
____

The Vipassana Research Institute consistently favours _sabbattatāya_ over
_sabbatthatāya_, except at one place, the just quoted Ud.33, where they take
_sabbatthatāya_, thereby acknowledging the decisiveness of the quote.

Although the Buddha Jayanti Version consistently favours _sabbattatāya_,
including at Ud.33, it consistently notes that _sabbatthatāya_ is a variant
reading.

The PED does not recognise _sabbattatāya_ as a word, only _sabbatthatāya_
whose meaning is 'the state of being everywhere.' The PED says that _atthata_
is the past participle of _attharati_, meaning 'spread, covered, spread over
with.' Likewise, DOP recognises _atthata_ but not _attata_.

Therefore we take _atthata_ (everywhere) as the correct spelling, and translate
as follows:

[quote, S.4.323]
____
in all directions, everywhere, he abides pervading the whole world [of beings]
with a mind of [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill.

_sabbadhi sabbatthatāya sabbāvantaṃ lokaṃ mettāsahagatena cetasā...
viharati._
____

===== Pervading [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill: world [of beings]

When one abides pervading the whole world with a mind of [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill (_sabbāvantaṃ lokaṃ mettāsahagatena cetasā...
pharitvā_), what does 'world' mean? Other suttas, and clues in the sutta
itself show that _mettā_ should be pervaded to the 'world [of beings],' a
practice which would therefore include devas.

===== Metta: adjective and adverb

For the adjective, we render _metta_ as 'loving.' In one case below we say
'lovingly.'

=== Moghapurisa

==== Renderings

- _mogha_: in vain

- _mogha_: false

- _moghapurisa_: worthless man

==== Introduction

===== Mogha: false

Where _mogha_ is the opposite of _sacca_, we render it as 'false':

[quote, M.1.498]
____
This alone is true. All else is false.

_idameva saccaṃ moghamaññan ti._
____

On this basis, _moghapurisa_ would be 'a false man' or 'an untrue man.'

===== Mogha: in vain

But in many contexts _mogha_ means 'in vain':

[quote, D.2.251]
____
The going forth [into the ascetic life] of all those noble young men was not in
vain or barren, but fruitful and productive.

_iti kho pana sabbesaṃ yeva tesaṃ kulaputtānaṃ amoghā pabbajjā ahosi
avañjhā saphalā saudrayā ti._
____

On this basis a _moghapurisa_ would be, for example, futile, unavailing,
incompetent, ineffectual, or useless. But 'vain' means something else, and its
synonyms seem harsh. Our 'worthless' is in accordance with other admonishments,
which including 'empty' and 'hollow':

Bhaddali, on that occasion, were you not an empty, hollow wrongdoer?

_Nanu tvaṃ bhaddāli tasmiṃ samaye ritto tuccho aparaddho ti._

=== Moha

==== Renderings

- _moha_: undiscernment of reality

- _amoha_: discernment of reality

- _vītamoha_: free of undiscernment of reality

- _asammūḷho_: discerning of reality

- _sammūḷho_: undiscerning of reality

==== Introduction

===== Moha: not 'delusion'

Because _moha_ is related to _muyhati,_ to be deluded, it is therefore usually
known as 'delusion.' However, this would imply that _moha_ is:

- 'a belief that has no evidence in fact' (www. vocabulary.com).

- 'a mistaken or unfounded opinion or idea' (WordWeb)

===== Moha: 'undiscernment of reality'

In this essay we will show that:

1. _moha_ is antonymous to _paññā_

2. _moha_ is synonymous with _avijjā_

3. _moha_ is associated with _aññāṇa_

4. _moha_ occurs in those who are _ariyadhamme akovide_

These four terms are shown in the Glossary to mean:

1. _paññā_: penetrative discernment

2. _avijjā_: uninsightfulness into reality

3. _aññāṇa_: ignorance [of things according to reality]

4. _ariyadhamme akovide_: those who are ignorant of the noble teaching

These associations suggest that _moha_ means uninsightfulness, which, to
discriminate it, we will call 'undiscernment of reality.'

===== Moha equals avijjā

_Moha_ equals _avijjā_ (i.e. uninsightfulness into reality):

[quote, A.1.195]
____
'What do you think, Sāḷha, is there discernment of reality?' -- 'Yes,
bhante' -- 'I call it insightfulness into reality.'

_Taṃ kiṃ maññatha sāḷhā atthi amoho ti? Evambhante. Vijjā ti kho
ahaṃ sāḷhā etamatthaṃ vadāmi._
____

[quote, Sn.v.730]
____
This uninsightfulness into reality is indeed undiscernment of reality whereby
this wandering the round of birth and death goes on for a long time.

_Avijjā hāyaṃ mahāmoho yenidaṃ saṃsitaṃ ciraṃ._
____

===== Moha and avijjā: same relationship to āsavas

_Moha_ and _avijjā_ both have the same relationship to perceptually obscuring
states (_āsavā_):

[quote, M.1.250]
____
_Moha_: It is through the abandonment of perceptually obscuring states that one
is discerning of reality.

_Āsavānaṃ hi aggivessana pahānā asammūḷho hoti._
____

[quote, M.1.55]
____
_Avijjā_: With the ending of perceptual obscuration comes the ending of
uninsightfulness into reality

_āsavanirodhā avijjānirodho._
____

===== Moha: associated with aññāṇa

_Moha_ is associated with ignorance [of things according to reality]
(_aññāṇapakkhā_):

[quote, Sn.v.347]
____
Whatever spiritual shackles there are in the world, [or] paths of undiscernment
of reality, [or] whatever is associated with ignorance [of things according to
reality], [or] whatever bases for doubt [about the significance of the
teaching] there are, when they reach the Perfect One they vanish.

_Ye keci ganthā idha mohamaggā aññāṇapakkhā vicikicchaṭṭhānā +

===== Moha: opposed to paññā

_Moha_ is opposed to _paññā,_ penetrative discernment:

[quote, A.3.446]
____
To abandon undiscernment of reality, penetrative discernment should be
developed._

COMMENT

_Nibbedhagāminī_: 'leads to the profound understanding [and destruction of
the great masses of greed, hatred, and undiscernment of reality]':
_Nibbijjhati_ means 'to pierce,' which we call 'to profoundly understand.' At
S.5.88 _nibbijjhati_ is linked to _padāleti_ (to destroy), and to
_lobhakkhandhaṃ dosakkhandhaṃ mohakkhandhaṃ_ ('the great masses of greed,
hatred, and undiscernment of reality').

=== Yamāmase

==== Renderings

- _yamāmase_: we face [the ever-present possibility of] death

==== Introduction

===== 'We face [the ever-present possibility of] death'

_Yamāmase_ occurs just five times in the scriptures, always in this one verse:

[quote, Th.v.275 etc]
____
Others do not understand that we here face [the ever-present possibility of]
death; but those who understand it, their quarrels cease.

_Pare ca na vijānanti mayamettha yamāmase +
Ye ca tattha vijānanti tato sammanti medhagā._
____

The verse also occurs at M.3.154; Dh.v.6; Th.v.498; and Vin.1.349.

Our interpretation of _yamāmase_ is primarily supported by Th.v.276 which
develops the theme of Th.v.275 in the following way:

[quote, Th.v.276]
____
And whilst those who do not understand it behave as though they were immortal,
those who understand the nature of reality are spiritually unailing amidst the
spiritually ailing.

_Yadā ca avijānantā iriyantyamarā viya; +
Vijānanti ca ye dhammaṃ āturesu anāturā._
____

So if Th.v.276 concerns people who behave as though they were immortal, then
Th.v.275 concerns people who understand that we here face [the ever-present
possibility of] death.

===== Etymology of yamāmase

The etymology of _yamāmase_ is unknown, but it can be interpreted in two ways,
either following PED's _Yama1_ or _Yama2_:

_Yama1_) This _Yama_ comes from _yam_- to restrain. _Yamāmase_ here is in the
reflective voice i.e. the object of the verb is the same as the subject. This
would give the meaning 'We must restrain ourselves.'

_Yama2_) This _Yama_ is linked to Vedic Yama, the ruler of the kingdom of the
dead. This would give the meaning 'We face [the ever-present possibility of]
death.'

===== Meaning of yamāmase: Norman

Norman has accepted both interpretations, translating them as follows:

[quote, Dh.v.6]
____
Others do not know that we should restrain ourselves here

_Pare ca na vijānanti mayamettha yamāmase._
____

[quote, Th.v.275]
____
Others too do not know that we come to an end here

_Pare ca na vijānanti mayamettha yamāmase._
____

He explains his divergent translations like this:

- 'The Commentary gives alternative explanations. In Th.v.275 I followed the
first of these interpretations... and translated "we come to an end here"
because there seemed to be a contrast with Th.v.276, where the ignorant act as
though they are immortal. In Dh.v.6 I translate _yam_- as "restrain" because it
seems to suit the context better... (Word of the Doctrine p.62).

When he says 'it seems to suit the context better,' he likely means that there
is no verse in the _Dhammapada_ corresponding to Th.v.276. But context has many
aspects. Let us consider the broader context.

===== Context of Dhammapada Verse 6 in Vinaya

_Dhammapada_ verse 6 concerns the bhikkhus of Kosambī, who, when asked by the
Buddha to stop quarrelling, told him:

[quote, Vin.1.341]
____
Bhante, let the Blessed One, the Lord of Truth, abide at ease devoted to
pleasant states of meditation in this lifetime. We are the ones who will take
responsibility for this quarrelling, arguing, disputing, and contentiousness.

_Āgametu bhante bhagavā dhammassāmi appossukko bhante bhagavā
diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāraṃ anuyutto viharatu. Mayametena bhaṇḍanena
kalahena viggahena vivādena paññāyissāmāti._
____

So the Buddha told them the story of Dīghāvu, the moral of which is:

[quote, Vin.1.347]
____
Unfriendly deeds are not stopped by unfriendliness. Unfriendly deeds, dear
Dīghāvu, are stopped by friendliness.

_na hi tāta dīghāvu verena verā sammanti. Averena hi tāta dīghāvu verā
sammantī ti._
____

When the Kosambī bhikkhus rejected these good words, the Buddha recited the
reflection we are now considering:

[quote, Vin.1.349]
____
Others do not understand that we here face [the ever-present possibility of]
death; but those who understand it, their quarrels cease.

_Pare ca na vijānanti mayamettha yamāmase +
Ye ca tattha vijānanti tato sammanti medhagā._
____

The story of Dīghāvu story does not decisively indicate the meaning of
_yamāmase_. It effectively says that quarrelsomeness can be overcome through
friendliness. But whether this friendliness is the result of self-restraint, or
of reflecting on death, is left unclear. So let us further consider the broader
context.

===== Further context of Dhammapada Verse 6: Majjhima Nikāya

The _Majjhima Nikāya_ explains the story of the Kosambī bhikkhus differently.
It says the Buddha told the Kosambī bhikkhus that there are six principles of
cordiality, but:

[quote, M.1.322]
____
'the chief, the most cohesive, the most unifying of these principles is [having
a shared] view that is noble, and which leads to deliverance [from suffering],
and which leads the one who practises it to the complete destruction of
suffering.'

_Imesaṃ kho bhikkhave channaṃ sārāṇīyānaṃ dhammānaṃ etaṃ
aggaṃ etaṃ saṅgāhikaṃ etaṃ saṅghātanikaṃ yadidaṃ yāyaṃ
diṭṭhi ariyā niyyātikā niyyāti takkarassa sammā dukkhakkhayāya._
____

We parenthesise '[having a shared]' because the sutta affirms this previously,
by saying that:

[quote, M.1.322]
____
Whatever view is noble, and which leads to deliverance [from suffering], and
which leads the one who practises it to the complete destruction of suffering,
a bhikkhu abides united in a view such as this with his companions in the
religious life, both in public and in private

_bhikkhu yāyaṃ diṭṭhi ariyā niyyānikā niyyāti takkarassa sammā
dukkhakkhayāya tathārūpāya diṭṭhiyā diṭṭhisāmaññagato viharati
sabrahmacārīhi āvī ceva raho ca._
____

Therefore, having a shared noble view is the foremost key to cordiality amongst
bhikkhus. So we will now consider whether the view that we face [the
ever-present possibility of] death can be regarded as a noble view. And we
meanwhile note that having a shared perception 'that we should restrain
ourselves' will play no further part in this argument because it is simply
unheard of in the suttas. The argument that quarrels might cease through
restraint would be stronger if it meant restraint of the sense faculties, but
that interpretation is denied here because the verb is in the reflective voice.

===== The perception of [the ever-present possibility of] death: a noble view?

That the perception of [the ever-present possibility of] death is a noble view,
and therefore the chief way to overcome quarrelsomeness, is clear from these
quotes:

1. Bhikkhus, there is one thing if developed and cultivated leads to complete
disillusionment [with originated phenomena], non-attachment [to originated
phenomena], the ending [of originated phenomena], inward peace, transcendent
insight, enlightenment, the Untroubled. What one thing? Mindfulness of [the
ever-present possibility of] death.
+
****
_Ekadhammo bhikkhave bhāvito bahulīkato ekantanibbidāya virāgāya
nirodhāya upasamāya abhiññāya sambodhāya nibbānāya saṃvattati. Katamo
ekadhammo? Maraṇasati_ (A.1.30).
****

2. Bhikkhus, mindfulness of [the ever-present possibility of] death, when
developed and cultivated is of great fruit and benefit, having the Deathless as
its culmination and conclusion.
+
****
_maraṇasati bhikkhave bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṃsā
amatogadhā amatapariyosānāti_ (A.3.307).
****

So the broader context does not indicate that _yamāmase_ should be interpreted
differently in Dh.v.6 than in Th.v.275. If the bhikkhus of Kosambī had
cultivated the perception of [the ever-present possibility of] death, their
quarrels would have ceased.

[quote, Th.v.275 etc]
____
Others do not understand that we here face [the ever-present possibility of]
death; but those who understand it, their quarrels cease.

_Pare ca na vijānanti mayamettha yamāmase +
Ye ca tattha vijānanti tato sammanti medhagā._
____

===== Cultivating the perception of [the ever-present possibility of] death

Mindfulness of [the ever-present possibility of] death is developed like this:

[quote, A.3.306]
____
Bhikkhus who develop mindfulness of [the ever-present possibility of] death
thus: 'If I could live just so long as it takes to swallow only one mouthful or
just so long as it takes to breathe in and out in order to contemplate the
Blessed One's word, much could be done by me' those bhikkhus are said to live
diligently. Keenly they develop mindfulness of [the ever-present possibility
of] death.

_Ime vuccanti bhikkhave bhikkhū appamattā viharanti tikkhaṃ maraṇasatiṃ
bhāventi._
____

-- In this regard, bhante, such is my thought: If I could live just a night and
day in order to contemplate the Blessed One's word, much could be done by me
(_aho vatāhaṃ rattindivaṃ jīveyyaṃ bhagavato sāsanaṃ
manasikareyyaṃ bahuṃ vata me kataṃ assā ti_).

Prestige is a worldly condition that stems partly from previous acts of
generosity:

-- Bhante, there might be two disciples equal in faith, in virtue, and in
discernment, but one is generous while the other is not. With the demise of the
body at death, they would both be reborn in the heavenly worlds. When they have
become devas, would there be any difference between them?

It is well for a bhikkhu to abide continuously mastering acquisition, loss,
prestige, imprestige, honour, depreciation, unvirtuous desires and unvirtuous
friendships that have arisen.

_Sādhu bhikkhave bhikkhu uppannaṃ lābhaṃ abhibhuyya abhibhuyya vihareyya.

===== Yasa: glory, atirocati

Sometimes _yasa_ is better called 'glory' because it is associated with
_atirocati_, to shine. For example, when, due to his virtuous qualities, a
pauper was reborn in the company of the Tāvatiṃsā devas:

[quote, S.1.232]
____
He outshone the other devas in beauty and glory.

===== Yasa: glory, the waxing fortnight

Sometimes _yasa_ is associated with the moon in the waxing fortnight, and again
must be called glory:

[quote, A.2.18]
____
If one transgresses what is righteous through desire, hatred, fear, or
undiscernment of reality, one's glory fades like the moon in the waning
fortnight.

_Chandā dosā bhayā mohā yo dhammaṃ ativattati +
Nihīyati tassa yaso kālapakkheva candimā ti_

If one does not transgress what is righteous through desire, hatred, fear, or
undiscernment of reality, one's glory swells like the moon in the waxing
fortnight.

=== Yoga

==== Renderings

- _yoga_: bondage [to individual existence]

- _yogā_: states of bondage [to individual existence]

- yoga: tie (= _saṃyojana_ metri causa)

- yoga: yoke

==== Introduction

===== Yoga: state of bondage [to individual existence]

The fourth state of bondage [to individual existence] is uninsightfulness into
reality (_avijjāyogo_). The first three states of bondage [to individual
existence] (_yogā_) arise from attachment to:

1. Sensuous pleasure

2. Individual existence

3. Views

Therefore the four states of bondage [to individual existence] can be rendered
as:

1. The bondage [to individual existence] that arises from [attachment to]
sensuous pleasure (_kāmayogo_).

2. The bondage [to individual existence] that arises from [attachment to]
states of individual existence (_bhavayogo_).

3. The bondage [to individual existence] that arises from dogmatism
(_diṭṭhiyogo_).

4. The bondage [to individual existence] that arises from uninsightfulness into
reality (_avijjāyogo_, D.3.230).

===== Where yoga stands for saṃyojana: tie

For metrical purposes, _yoga_ sometimes stands for _saṃyojana_, 'tie'.
Consider these examples:

[quote, It.50]
____
They who are tethered [to individual existence] by the tie of craving
(_taṇhāyogena_)

_Taṇhāyogena saṃyuttā_
____

Here in verse, _yoga_ stands for _saṃyojana_, which can be proved because in
the following prose quote _taṇhāsaṃyojana_ replaces _taṇhāyogena:_

[quote, It.8]
____
Tethered [to individual existence] by the tie of craving
(_taṇhāsaṃyojanena_), beings roam and wander the round of birth and death
for a long time.

_Taṇhāsaṃyojanena hi bhikkhave saṃyuttā sattā dīgharattaṃ
sandhāvanti saṃsarantī ti._
____

In this next quote, again verse, _saṃyojana_ is shown to equal _yogāni_,
and therefore _pāpimayogāni_ means _pāpimasaṃyojanāni:_

[quote, D.2.274]
____
Like the elephant that bursts all its fastenings and chains, they severed the
ties and bonds (_saṃyojana_) [to individual existence] in the sensuous plane
of existence, those ties of the Maleficent One (_pāpimayogāni_) so hard to
overcome.

_Te kāmasaṃyojanabandhanāni pāpimayogāni duraccayāni +
Nāgoca sandānaguṇāni chetvā._
____

The presence of plural _yogāni_ supports our assertion here, because according
to our schedule of renderings _yoga_ is usually uncountable 'bondage', whereas
_saṃyojana_ is countable 'tie.'

===== Rarely: yoke

_Yoga_ occasionally means yoke:

[quote, It.53]
____
Beings who perceive [only] what can be expressed... come under the yoke of
death;

_Akkheyyasaññino sattā... yogamāyanti maccuno._
____

==== Introduction

===== Yoga: states of bondage [to individual existence]

In relation to _yogakkhema_, _yoga_ means the four states of bondage [to
individual existence]. These are listed in the _Yoga Sutta_ (A.2.10), as
follows:

1. the bondage [to individual existence] that arises from [attachment to]
sensuous pleasure
+
****
_kāmayogo_
****

2. the bondage [to individual existence] that arises from [attachment to]
states of individual existence

+
****
_diṭṭhiyogo_
****

4. the bondage [to individual existence] that arises from uninsightfulness into
reality
+
****
_avijjāyogo_
****

This issue is discussed sv _Yoga_.

===== Khema: safety

_Khema_ means safe or safety (see sv _Khema_).

[quote, Dh.v.189]
____
Those are not safe refuges. Those are not the supreme refuge.

_Netaṃ kho saraṇaṃ khemaṃ netaṃ saraṇamuttamaṃ._
____

[quote, A.3.104]
____
In a time of peril, people migrate to places of safety

_Bhaye kho pana sati manussā yena khemaṃ tena saṅkamanti._
____

===== Safety from [the danger of] bondage [to individual existence]

Bondage [to individual existence] (_yoga_) is a danger because it involves
being tethered to unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors. The unpleasant
consequences of this are described in the _Yoga Sutta_, as follows:

[quote, A.2.11]
____
He is tethered to unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors that are defiling
and which lead to renewed states of individual existence, suffering, unpleasant
karmic consequences, and future birth, old age, and death. Thus he is called
one who has not reached safety from the danger of bondage [to individual
existence].

_Saṃyutto pāpakehi akusalehi dhammehi saṅkilesikehi ponobhavikehi sadarehi
dukkhavipākehi āyatiṃ jātijarāmaraṇikehi tasmā ayogakkhemī ti
vuccati._
____

Therefore _yogakkhema_ does not mean safety from bondage [to individual
existence], but safety from the danger of bondage [to individual existence].

===== Yogakkhemī = 'one who has reached safety'

One who realises _yogakkhema_ is called _yogakkhemī_ which could mean either:

- one who is safe from the danger of bondage [to individual existence], or,

- one who has reached safety from the danger of bondage [to individual
existence]

But _yogakkhema_ occurs in the phrases with the verbs _ārādhayanti_ and
_nānupāpuṇāti_, which indicates that _yogakkhema_ is something one
attains, but does not become:

[quote, It.111]
____
They fathom the true teaching; both attain unsurpassed safety from the danger
of bondage [to individual existence].

_ārādhayanti saddhammaṃ yogakkhemaṃ anuttaraṃ._
____

[quote, M.1.105]
____
He does not reach unsurpassed safety from the danger of bondage [to individual
existence]

_anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ nānupāpuṇāti._
____

Therefore _yogakkhemī_ means one who has reached safety from the danger of
bondage [to individual existence]. One does not oneself become absolutely safe.
Being _yogakkhemī_ is not a personal attainment.

===== Khemī and khematta: abbreviations for yogakkhemī

_Khemī_ and _khematta_ occur in verses and by implying _yogakkhemī_, they can
be taken as such because the Buddha offers no other safety.

=== Yogo karaṇīyo

==== Renderings

- _yogo karaṇīyo_: an effort should be made [to profoundly understand this]

- _yogo karaṇīyo_: an effort should be made [to abandon this].

- _yogo karaṇīyo_: an effort should be made [to realise this].

- _yogo karaṇīyo_: an effort should be made [to develop this].

- _yogo karaṇīyo_: should endeavour [to study and master]

- _yogo karaṇīyo_: should endeavour [to attain]

==== Introduction

===== Yogo karaṇīyo: which infinitive?

_Yogo karaṇīyo_ commonly occurs with a nominative, locative, or
instrumental, but never with an infinitive. Therefore the phrase _Idaṃ
dukkhan ti yogo karaṇīyo_ strictly means, 'This is suffering. An effort
should be made.' But what effort? To see? To understand? To realise?

===== In parenthesis: to profoundly understand, abandon, realise, develop

The _Pariññeyya Sutta_ (S.5.436) explains _yogo karaṇīyo_ in the context
of the four noble truths, and therefore shows in this context how it should be
parenthesised, as follows:

[quote, S.5.436]
____
Of these four noble truths, there is a noble truth to be profoundly understood,
a noble truth to be abandoned, a noble truth to be realised, a noble truth to
be developed.

_Imesaṃ kho bhikkhave catunnaṃ ariyasaccānaṃ atthi ariyasaccaṃ
pariññeyyaṃ atthi ariyasaccaṃ pahātabbaṃ atthi ariyasaccaṃ
sacchikātabbaṃ atthi ariyasaccaṃ bhāvetabbaṃ_

What is the noble truth to be profoundly understood?

_Katamañca bhikkhave ariyasaccaṃ pariññeyyaṃ_

Suffering is a noble truth to be profoundly understood.

_dukkhaṃ bhikkhave ariyasaccaṃ pariññeyyaṃ_

The origin of suffering is a noble truth to be abandoned.

_dukkhasamudayo ariyasaccaṃ pahātabbaṃ_

The ending of suffering is a noble truth to be realised.

_dukkhanirodho ariyasaccaṃ sacchikātabbaṃ_

The practice leading to the ending of suffering is a noble truth to be
developed.

_dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ariyasaccaṃ bhāvetabbaṃ._

Therefore, bhikkhus:

_Tasmātiha bhikkhave_

'This is suffering': an effort should be made [to profoundly understand this]._

_idaṃ dukkhan ti yogo karaṇīyo_

'This is the origin of suffering': an effort should be made [to abandon this]._

_ayaṃ dukkhasamudayo ti yogo karaṇīyo_

'This is the ending of suffering': an effort should be made [to realise this]._

_ayaṃ dukkhanirodhoti yogo karaṇīyo_

'This is the practice leading to the ending of suffering': an effort should be
made [to develop this]._

_ayaṃ dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ti yogo karaṇīyoti._
____

===== In parenthesis: to study and master

The _Gulissāni Sutta_ says:

[quote, M.1.472]
____
A forest bhikkhu should endeavour [to study and master] advanced aspects of the
teaching and discipline

_Āraññakenāvuso bhikkhunā abhidhamme abhivinaye yogo karaṇīyo._
____

The parenthesis 'to study and master' comes from the _Āṇi Sutta_, which says:

[quote, S.2.267]
____
When those discourses spoken by the Perfect One that are profound, profound in
meaning, transcendental, connected with the [perception of the] absence [of any
abiding phenomena] are being recited, we will really listen, lend an ear, and
apply our minds to understand [them], and we will think those teachings should
be studied and mastered (_uggahetabbaṃ pariyāpuṇitabbaṃ_). Thus should
you train yourselves.

_ye te suttantā tathāgatabhāsitā gambhīrā gambhīratthā lokuttarā
suññatapaṭisaṃyuttā tesu bhaññamānesu sussusissāma sotaṃ

pariyāpuṇitabbaṃ maññissāmā ti. Evaṃ hi vo bhikkhave sikkhitabbanti._
____

===== In parenthesis: to attain

The _Gulissāni Sutta_ says:

[quote, M.1.472]
____
A forest bhikkhu should endeavour [to attain] those immaterial states of
awareness, those peaceful states of refined awareness that transcend the
refined material states of awareness.

_Āraññakenāvuso bhikkhunā ye te santā vimokkhā atikkamma rūpe āruppā
tattha yogo karaṇīyo._
____

The parenthesis 'to attain' (_lābhī ceva hoti_) comes from the
_Tatiyasamādhi Sutta_ (A.2.94) which says a bhikkhu should ask how to attain
states of inward composure.

[quote, A.2.92]
____
Later on he attains inward calm.

_So aparena samayena... lābhī ca ajjhattaṃ cetosamathassa._
____

===== In parenthesis: to attain

The _Gulissāni Sutta_ says:

[quote, M.1.472]
____
A forest bhikkhu should endeavour [to attain] a superhuman attainment

_Āraññakenāvuso bhikkhunā uttarimanussadhamme yogo karaṇīyo._
____

The parenthesis 'to attain' (_adhigato_) comes from the _Dasadhamma Sutta_:

[quote, A.5.87]
____
One who has gone forth [into the ascetic life] should frequently reflect: 'Have
I attained (_adhigato_) a superhuman attainment of knowledge and vision such
that when questioned in my last days by my companions in the religious life, I
will not be ashamed?'

_Atthinu kho me uttarimanussadhammā alamariyañāṇadassana viseso adhigato
sohaṃ pacchime kāle sabrahmacārīhi puṭṭho na maṅkubhavissāmī ti
pabbajitena abhiṇhaṃ paccavekkhitabbaṃ._
____

===== With instrumental case: to attain

In the following quote, the instrumental _ñāṇāya yogo karaṇīyo_
indicates 'for the sake of,' which supports our parenthesising with the
infinitive 'to attain:'

[quote, S.2.129]
____
Bhikkhus, one who does not know and see according to reality old age and death
should endeavour [to attain] knowledge of old age and death according to reality

_jarāmaraṇaṃ bhikkhave ajānatā apassatā yathābhūtaṃ jarāmaraṇe
yathābhūtaṃ ñāṇāya yogo karaṇīyo._
____

This parenthesis is further justified by the _Dasadhamma Sutta_ mentioned
above, where _ñāṇa_ is linked to _adhigato_:

[quote, A.5.87]
____
Have I attained (_adhigato_) a superhuman attainment of knowledge and vision

_Atthinu kho me uttarimanussadhammā alamariyañāṇadassana viseso adhigato._
____

===== With instrumental case: to attain

In the following quote, the instrumental _adhipaññādhammavipassanāya yogo
karaṇīyo_ again indicates 'for the sake of,' which supports our again
parenthesising with the infinitive 'to attain:'

[quote, A.2.93]
____
The person who attains inward calm, but not the factors of higher penetrative
discernment and insightfulness, having firmly established inward calm, should
endeavour [to attain] the factors of higher penetrative discernment and
insightfulness.

_Tatra bhikkhave yvāyaṃ puggalo lābhī hoti ajjhattaṃ cetosamathassa na
lābhī adhipaññādhammavipassanāya tena bhikkhave puggalena ajjhattaṃ
cetosamathe patiṭṭhāya adhipaññādhammavipassanāya yogo karaṇīyo._
____

This parenthesis is further justified by the occurrence in the sentence of
_lābhī hoti_, 'he attains.'

==== Introduction

===== To supervise [with mindfulness], or to be supervised [by mindfulness]

The main purpose of this section is to explain our parenthesis '[by
mindfulness]'. We have shown that _saṃvara_ means restraint [of the sense
faculties] [from attraction and repulsion, through mindfulness] (sv
_Saṃvara_). Likewise, when _rakkhati_ or _rakkhita_ means supervise or
supervised, the expressions _ārakkhasatino_ and _satārakkhena_ in the
following quote shows it means to supervise [with mindfulness] or to be
supervised [by mindfulness]:

[quote, A.3.138]
____
Come on, friend, abide with sense portals guarded [by mindfulness]. Take
mindfulness as your supervisor. Be aware and mindful, and have a mind that is
supervised [by mindfulness], a mind under the supervision of mindfulness.

And how is he a supervisor?

_rakkhitā hoti_

Bhikkhus, in seeing a visible object via the visual sense,

_cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā_

he does not grasp its aspects and features

_na nimittaggāhī nānuvyañjanaggāhī_

since by abiding with the faculty of sight unrestrained [from attraction and
repulsion, through mindfulness]

_yatvādhikaraṇametaṃ cakkhundriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ viharantaṃ_

greed, dejection, and unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors would pursue
him.

_abhijjhādomanassā pāpakā akusalā dhammā anvāssaveyyuṃ_

He applies himself to the restraint of the faculty [from attraction and

_Citte gahapati arakkhite kāyakammampi arakkhitaṃ hoti. Vacī kammampi
arakkhitaṃ hoti. Manokammampi arakkhitaṃ hoti._

When acts of body, speech, and mind are unsupervised [by the mind], they are
spiritually defiled._

arakkhitamanokammantassa kāyakammampi avassutaṃ hoti. Vacīkammampi

Even if protected by an army of elephants, cavalry or chariots, they do not
[spiritually] protect themselves. Why? Because that protection is external not

- _rati_: delight

- _rati_: sensuous delight

- _rata_: delighting/finding delight (in solitude)

- _rata_: delighting/taking delight in

- _arati_: disgruntlement [with the celibate life]

- _arati_: disgust

==== Introduction

===== Abhi- prefix redundant

_Rata_ is the past participle of _ramati_. _Abhi_- is usually prefixed, but it
makes no discernable difference to the meaning of _rati_ or _ramati_, therefore
we treat it as redundant, and treat related terms as synonyms.

We see the switching in the following passage, between prefix and no prefix.
Although the dictionaries say _abhi_- has an intensifying effect, paradoxically
the lower pleasures have the prefix:

[quote, M.1.505]
____
There is, Māgandiya, a delight that is unrelated to sensuous pleasures,
unrelated to spiritually unwholesome factors, which surpasses even divine
pleasure.

_Yāhayaṃ māgaṇḍiya rati aññatreva kāmehi aññatra akusalehi
dhammehi api dibbaṃ sukhaṃ samadhigayha tiṭṭhati_

(...) Since I took pleasure in that delight, I did not covet what is inferior,
nor did I take pleasure in it.

_tāya ratiyā ramamāno hīnassa na pihemi na tattha abhiramāmi._
____

===== Discriminating wholesome and unwholesome

_Rati_ and _arati_ are sometimes wholesome, sometimes unwholesome. This is
often clear enough from context, and therefore no qualifying adjective is
needed:

[quote, S.4.117]
____
They took (wholesome) delight in what is righteous and in meditation.

_Dhamme ca jhāne ca ratā ahesuṃ._
____

[quote, Sn.v.709]
____
The wise man should be (wholesomely) delighted in the woods.

_dhīro vanante ramito siyā._
____

[quote, S.4.389]
____
It is one who (unwholesomely) delights in bodily form... who would assert that
'A Perfect One continues to exist after death.'

_rūparatassa... tathāgato parammaraṇāti pi'ssa hoti._
____

[quote, A.4.230]
____
This teaching is for those who take (wholesome) delight in unentrenched
perception

_ayaṃ dhammo nippapañcaratino._
____

[quote, S.5.393]
____
Taking (wholesome) delight in relinquishment

_vossagarato._
____

[quote, Thī.v.164]
____
Taking (unwholesome) delight in Māra's realm

_mārassa visaye ratā._
____

[quote, Sn.v.274-5]
____
One who (unwholesomely) delights in doing harm

_vihesābhirato._
____

[quote, S.1.133]
____
Direct your mind there (to those realms) and you'll experience (unwholesome)
delight.

_tattha cittaṃ paṇidhehi ratiṃ paccanubhossasīti._
____

Sometimes _rati_ seems neither wholesome or unwholesome, for example when
cool-cloud devas think:

[quote, S.3.256]
____
'Let us revel in our own kind of (neither wholesome nor unwholesome)
delight,' then, in accordance with their wish, it becomes cool.

_yannūna mayaṃ sakāya ratiyā rameyyāmāti tesaṃ taṃ
cetopaṇidhimanvāya sītaṃ hoti._
____

===== Rati and arati in bhikkhus: wholesome and unwholesome

One type of _rati_ and _arati_ concerns bhikkhus, not lay people, because they
are linked to _dhammavinaya_ and _brahmacariya_. Here they are opposites:
_rati_ is wholesome, and _arati_ is unwholesome. For example:

[quote, A.5.122]
____
Disgruntlement in this teaching and training system is suffering, and delight
in it is happiness

_anabhirati kho āvuso imasmiṃ dhammavinaye dukkhā abhirati sukhā._
____

[quote, A.3.146]
____
He lives the celibate life disgruntled...lives the celibate life with delight _

_anabhirato... abhirato ca brahmacariyaṃ carati._
____

We choose the association with 'celibate life' as the default basis for our
renderings, namely:

- _arati_: disgruntlement [with the celibate life]
- _rati_: delight [in the celibate life]

This is appropriate because _arati_ is linked to lust:

[quote, S.1.186]
____
At one time, disgruntlement [with the celibate life] had arisen in
Venerable Vaṅgīsa. Lust had invaded his mind

_Tena kho pana samayena āyasmato vaṅgīsassa anabhirati uppannā hoti
rāgo cittaṃ anuddhaṃseti._
____

But the terms could otherwise have been called:

- disgruntlement [with the teaching and training system]
- delight [in the teaching and training system]

===== Aratirati: both unwholesome

Sometimes _rati_ and _arati_ are both unwholesome, and not opposites:

- _arati_: disgruntlement [with the celibate life]
- _rati_: sensuous delight

In this case, _rati_ means _kāmarati_, and because of the potential confusion,
it needs its 'sensuous' adjective:

[quote, Th.v.1214]
____
Having abandoned disgruntlement [with the celibate life] (_aratiṃ_) and
sensuous delight (_ratiṃ_) entirely, and thoughts connected with the
household life, one should not cultivate craving for anything. One who is free
of craving, being without craving, he is a bhikkhu.

_aratiṃ ratiñca pahāya sabbaso gehesitañca vitakkaṃ +
Vanathaṃ na kareyya kuhiñci nibbanatho avanatho sa bhikkhu._
____

[quote, "Dh.v.418, Sn.v.642, M.2.196"]
____
One who has abandoned both sensuous delight (_ratiṃ_) and disgruntlement
[with the celibate life] (_aratiṃ_), one who is freed from inward distress,
free of attachment, one who has transcended the whole world [of phenomena], a
Hero, he is what I call a Brahman.

_Hitvā ratiñca aratiñca sītibhūtaṃ nirupadhiṃ +
Sabbalokābhibhuṃ vīraṃ tamahaṃ brūmi brāhmaṇaṃ._
____

===== Disgruntlement [with the celibate life] and sensuous delight: stem from love

Disgruntlement [with the celibate life] and sensuous delight both stem from
love:

[quote, Sn.v.271-2]
____
Disgruntlement [with the celibate life], sensuous delight, and excitement are
born here, [in oneself]. Arising here, [in oneself], are thoughts in the mind,
like boys throwing up a [captive] crow.

_Aratī ratī lomahaṃso itojā +
Ito samuṭṭhāya manovitakkā kumārakā dhaṅkamivossajanti._

(...) They are born from love. They arise within oneself like the shoots from the
trunk of a banyan tree.

_Snehajā attasambhūtā nigrodhasseva khandhajā._
____

===== Aratirati: the mastery of

The _Ākaṅkheyya Sutta_ says disgruntlement [with the celibate life] and
sensuous delight are overcome through practises of virtue, jhāna, insight, and
the cultivation of solitude:

[quote, M.1.34]
____
If a bhikkhu should wish 'May I overcome disgruntlement [with the celibate
life] and sensuous delight, and may disgruntlement [with the celibate life] not
overcome me; may I abide mastering disgruntlement [with the celibate life]
whenever it arises,'

_ākaṅkheyya ce bhikkhave bhikkhu aratiratisaho assaṃ na ca maṃ arati
saheyya uppannaṃ aratiṃ abhibhuyya abhibhuyya vihareyyan ti_

he should fulfil the precepts

_sīlesvevassa paripūrakārī_

be given to inward calm,

_ajjhattaṃ cetosamathamanuyutto_

be not neglectful of meditation,

_anirākatajjhāno_

be endowed with insightfulness,

_vipassanāya samannāgato_

cultivate solitary abodes.

_brūhetā suññāgārānaṃ._
____

===== Overcoming disgruntlement: Ariyavaṃsa Sutta

In the _Ariyavaṃsa Sutta_ (A.2.27), the battle against disgruntlement with
the celibate life is conveyed in terms of war_._ The sutta promotes lifestyle
guidelines, not quick techniques. The sutta says one overcomes _arati_ through
being content with 'any old robe, almsfood and abode whatsoever'
(_santuṭṭho hoti itarītarena cīvarena... piṇḍapātena...
senāsanena_) and through finding enjoyment in one's spiritual development
(_bhāvanārāmo hoti bhāvanārato pahānārāmo hoti pahānarato_):

[quote, A.2.27-9]
____
Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is possessed of these four noble traditional ways of
behaviour, if he dwells in the east he overcomes disgruntlement [with the
celibate life], disgruntlement [with the celibate life] does not overcome him;
if he dwells in the west... in the north... in the south...

_Imehi ca pana bhikkhave catūhi ariyavaṃsehi samannāgato bhikkhu
puratthimāya cepi disāya viharati sveva aratiṃ sahati na taṃ arati
sahati._
____

The _Dasuttara Sutta_ (D.3.249) gives a direct technique aimed at _arati_,
namely the practice of [unlimited, all-encompassing] joy (_muditā
cetovimutti_):

____
For this is the liberation from disgruntlement [with the celibate life] namely
the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through [unlimited,
all-encompassing] joy.

_nissaraṇaṃ hetaṃ āvuso aratiyā yadidaṃ muditā cetovimuttī ti._

It says if the practice of [unlimited, all-encompassing] joy is developed and
cultivated, it is impossible, out of the question, that disgruntlement [with
the celibate life] would plague one's mind. There is no such possibility.

_aṭṭhānametaṃ āvuso anavakāso yaṃ muditāya cetovimuttiyā
bhāvitāya bahulīkatāya... atha ca panassa arati cittaṃ pariyādāya
ṭhassatī ti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati_
____

The _Udumbarika Sutta_ (D.3.49) says the practice of _muditā cetovimuttī_
mentioned in the _Dasuttara Sutta_ in fact has several preliminary steps:

1. Virtue
+
****
_na pāṇamatipāteti_, etc
****

2. Living in solitude
+
****
_so vivittaṃ senāsanaṃ bhajati_ etc
****

3. The practice of mindfulness
+
****
_ujuṃ kāyaṃ paṇidhāya parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā_ etc
****

4. Freedom from the five hindrances
+
****
_so abhijjhaṃ loke pahāya vigatābhijjhena cetasā viharati etc_
****

5. Finally, the practice of the four divine abidings including _muditā_, the
subject of the _Dasuttara Sutta_
+
****
_muditāsahagatena cetasā ekaṃ disaṃ pharitvā viharati_ etc
****

Thus, again, overcoming _arati_ is not only a matter of practising _muditā_
but also of undertaking lifestyle changes as well.

The _Parisā Sutta_ says that in whatsoever community the bhikkhus dwell
together in unity (_samaggā_), on friendly terms (_sammodamānā_), without
quarrelling (_avivadamānā_), like milk and water mixed
(_khīrodakībhūtā_), viewing each other with affection (_aññamaññaṃ
piyacakkhūhi sampassantā_), such a community is called united (_samaggā
parisā_).

[quote, A.1.243]
____
When bhikkhus dwell like this, they dwell in a divine abiding, that is to say,
in the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through _muditā_,
[unlimited, all-encompassing] joy.

_Brahmaṃ bhikkhave vihāraṃ tasmiṃ samaye bhikkhū viharanti yadidaṃ
muditāya cetovimuttiyā._
____

This implies that disgruntlement with the celibate life comes from living in
disunity, on unfriendly terms, quarrelling, and viewing other people with
disaffection. It is not just a matter of lust. Overcoming disgruntlement would
therefore involve either overcoming these factors, or living in solitude.

===== Sensuous delight: kāmaratī

Sensuous delight sometimes has a _kāma_- prefix:

[quote, Thī.v.381]
____
Seeing your eyes, my sensuous delight (_kāmaratī_) increases all the more.

_Tava me nayanānudikkhiya bhiyyo kāmaratī pavaḍḍhati._
____

Often, however, there is no _kāma_- prefix, and in translation, likewise, the
'sensuous' adjective is not necessary because the context is clear enough:

[quote, Sn.v.59]
____
Being unsatisfied with amusement, delight (_ratiṃ_), and sensuous pleasure,
being indifferent [to them].

_Khiḍḍaṃ ratiṃ kāmasukhañca loke analaṅkaritvā anapekkhamāno._
____

[quote, Sn.v.41]
____
In the midst of companions there is amusement, delight (_ratī_).

_khiḍḍā ratī hoti sahāyamajjhe._
____

===== Arati: wholesome disgust

_Arati_ can mean wholesome disgust:

[quote, A.5.111]
____
And what Ānanda, is the perception of disgust for the whole world [of
phenomena]?

_sabbaloke anabhiratasaññā_

(...) In this regard, Ānanda, for whatever in the world [of phenomena] there is
clinging, grasping, obstinate adherence, stubborn attachment, and
identification, a bhikkhu abides abandoning, not grasping.

_ye loke upayupādānā cetaso adhiṭṭhānābhinivesānusayā te pajahanto
viharati na upādiyanto._
____

=== Limpati

==== Renderings

- _limpati_: to tarnish

- _limpati_: to cleave to

- _lippati_: to be tarnished by

- _upalimpati_: to cleave to

- _upalippati_: to be tarnished by

==== Introduction

===== Spelling: lippati and limpati

PED says that in the _Suttanipāta_, whether the spelling is _limpati_ or
_lippati_ is 'doubtful,' because both words are found as readings, but it
acknowledges that _lippati_ is passive. Therefore _limpati_ is active.

Support for either spelling can be found amongst the various sutta editions, so
we choose spelling according to our own schedule. Where the passive sense is
meant, we choose _lippati_, _lippasi_ and _upalippati_ in preference to
_limpati_, _limpasi_ and _upalimpati_. This spelling is usually supported by
the VRI edition, and usually unsupported by the BJT edition.

===== Case indicators

- The passive sense (_lippati_) is indicated by the instrumental case.

- The active sense (_limpati_) takes an object in the locative case.

===== Limpati: cleave to, or tarnish

The active sense (_limpati_) mostly means 'cleave to,' but occasionally
'tarnish':

- Just as a waterdrop does not cleave to a lotus leaf (_udabindu yathāpi
pokkhare... na limpati_)... likewise the sage does not cleave to what is seen
(_evaṃ muni nopalimpati yadidaṃ diṭṭha_ Sn.v.812).

[quote, Sn.v.811]
____
Lamentation and stinginess do not tarnish him, just as water does not tarnish a
lotus leaf.

_Tasmiṃ paridevamaccharaṃ paṇṇe vāri yathā na limpati._
____

===== Lippati: tarnished by [attachment to]

The passive sense (_lippati_) always means 'tarnished by [attachment to]' or
'tarnished by [contact with].'

- a white lotus is untarnished by [contact with] water (_nūpalippati_ A.2.39).

The advantage of these parentheses can be seen in illustrations below, but
consider this one:

[quote, Th.v.1180]
____
He is untarnished by [attachment to] originated phenomena as the lotus is
untarnished by [contact with] water.

_Puṇḍarīkaṃ va toyena saṅkhārenupalippati._
____

Norman says: 'He is not defiled by the constituent elements as the lotus is not
defiled by water.' But constituent elements are not themselves defiling. As the
suttas say:

[quote, A.3.411]
____
The world's attractive things remain as they are. The wise eliminate their
hankering for them.

_Tiṭṭhanti citrāni tatheva loke athettha dhīrā vinayanti chandan ti._
____

===== Upalitta: past participle

_Upalitta_ operates as the past participle of both _upalimpati_ and
_upalippati_. Thus it means either 'one who cleaves' or 'one who is tarnished
by [attachment to].'

===== Upa- prefix

The _upa_- prefix is insignificant. It associated with both cleaving and
tarnishing. Words with or without the prefix are used interchangeably.

- _paraṃ lokaṃ_: the planes of existence beyond it

==== Introduction

===== World: profusion of meanings

_Loka_ can occasionally be rendered as simply 'world,' meaning 'physical
world.' But usually this is not the meaning, and _loka_ is often used in a
symbolic sense. Even in English 'world' has such a profusion of meanings, that
in translation it is helpful to indicate which of these meanings is meant.

===== World [of phenomena]

The world [of phenomena] is defined in the following quote as:

1. whatever is destined to decay, and

2. the elements of sensation.

[quote, S.4.53]
____
Whatever is destined to decay is called 'the world [of phenomena]' in the
[terminology of the] Noble One's training system. And what is destined to
decay? The visual sense is destined to decay. Visible objects are destined to
decay. Advertence to the visual field is destined to decay. Visual sensation is
destined to decay. Whatever sense impression that arises due to visual
sensation -- whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral -- it is destined to
decay... Whatever sense impression that arises due to mental sensation --
whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral -- it is destined to decay.

_Yaṃ kho ānanda palokadhammaṃ ayaṃ vuccati ariyassa vinaye loko. Kiñca
ānanda palokadhammaṃ? Cakkhuṃ kho ānanda palokadhammaṃ rūpā
palokadhammā cakkhuviññāṇaṃ palokadhammaṃ cakkhusamphasso

manosamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā
adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi palokadhammaṃ._
____

===== Pervading [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill: world [of beings]

The potential for confusion between meanings of 'world' is obvious, for
example, when one abides pervading the whole world with a mind of [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill (_sabbāvantaṃ lokaṃ mettāsahagatena cetasā...
pharitvā_). The issue is easily resolved by studying other suttas, and by
using clues in the sutta itself: _mettā_ should be pervaded to the 'world [of
beings],' a practice which would therefore include devas.

===== Disgust for the whole world: world [of phenomena]

Further potential confusion can be found, for example, if one strives to
develop the perception of 'disgust for the whole world' (_sabbaloke
anabhiratasaññā_). Does this mean disgust for worldly affairs? The sutta
itself, quoted next, makes it clear that the disgust concerns objects of
attachment. Therefore 'whole world' means 'whole world [of phenomena]':

[quote, A.5.111]
____
And what Ānanda, is the perception of disgust for the whole world [of
phenomena]?

_sabbaloke anabhiratasaññā_

In this regard, Ānanda, for whatever in the world [of phenomena] there is
clinging, grasping, obstinate adherence, stubborn attachment, and
identification, a bhikkhu abides abandoning, not grasping.

_ye loke upayupādānā cetaso adhiṭṭhānābhinivesānusayā te pajahanto
viharati na upādiyanto._
____

===== Brahmajāla Sutta: world [of beings]

The _Brahmajāla Sutta_ explains different views of ascetics and Brahmanists
concerning the world, the shape and size of it, and whether it is eternal or
not. For most of them, 'world' means 'the world [of beings].' But for the
Extensionists (_antānantikā_), it means 'the physical world.'

(1) The ascetics and Brahmanists who are Eternalists proclaim the eternity of
the [absolute] Selfhood and the world [of beings] in four ways:

****
_ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā sassatavādā sassataṃ attānañca
lokañcapaññapenti catūhi vatthūhi_
****

____
Eternal are the [absolute] Selfhood and the world [of beings]

_sassato attā ca loko ca_
____

(2) The ascetics and Brahmanists who are Partial-Etemalists proclaim the partial
eternity and partial non-eternity of the [absolute] Selfhood and the world [of
beings] in four ways

****
_samaṇabrāhmaṇā ekaccasassatikā ekaccaasassatikā ekaccaṃ sassataṃ
ekaccaṃ asassataṃ attānañca lokañca paññāpenti catūhi vatthūhi_
****

____
That illustrious Brahmā is everlasting, but we who were formed by him are
unlasting

_brahmā nicco mayaṃ aniccā_

Those devas who are not spiritually defiled by merriment are everlasting, but
we are unlasting

_te devā niccā mayaṃ aniccā_

Those devas who do not spend an excessive amount of time gazing at each other,
their minds do not become defiled, because of which they do not become weary in
body and mind. Therefore they are everlasting, but we are unlasting

_te devā niccā mayaṃ aniccā_

This which is called the visual sense and the auditory sense and the olfactory
sense and the gustatory sense and the tactile sense is an [absolute] Selfhood
that is unlasting, but this which is called 'mind' or 'cognition' or
'consciousness' (_idaṃvuccati cittan ti vā mano ti vā viññāṇan ti_) is
an [absolute] Selfhood that is everlasting

_ayaṃ attā anicco ayaṃ attā nicco_
____

(3) The ascetics and Brahmanists who are Extensionists proclaim the finitude and
infinitude in extent of the physical world on four grounds:

****
_eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā antānantikā antānantaṃ lokassa paññāpenti
catūhi vatthūhi_
****

[quote, D.1.22-25]
____
Finite in extent is the physical world, and spherical

_antavā ayaṃ loko parivaṭumo_

Infinite in extent is the physical world, and limitless

_ananto ayaṃ loko apariyanto_

The physical world is both finite and infinite in extent (finite in the upward
and downward directions, but infinite across)

_antavā ca ayaṃ loko ananto ca_

The physical world is neither finite nor infinite in extent

_nevāyaṃ loko antavā na panānanto ti._
____

===== 'World [of beings]': from the view of personal identity

The _Brahmajāla Sutta_'s views of 'the world' arise from the view of personal
identity. See next quote. This confirms that 'world' means 'world [of beings].'
But it is not so clear how the Extensionists' views concerning the finitude and
infinitude in extent of the physical world could arise from the view of
personal identity.

[quote, S.4.287]
____
'As to the various dogmatic views that arise in the world, householder, "The
world [of beings] is eternal..".. these as well as the sixty-two dogmatic views
mentioned in the Brahmajāla: when there is the view of personal identity
(_sakkāyadiṭṭhi_), these views come to be. Without the view of personal
identity, these views do not come to be.'

_Yā imā gahapati anekavihitā diṭṭhiyo loke uppajjanti: sassato lokoti
vā... yānicimāni dvāsaṭṭhi diṭṭhigatāni brahmajāle bhaṇitāni.
Imā kho gahapati diṭṭhiyo sakkāya diṭṭhiyā sati honti sakkāya
diṭṭhiyā asati na hontī ti._
____

===== Lokāyatika Brāhmaṇa Sutta: two meanings of loka

In the _Lokāyatika Brāhmaṇa Sutta_ (A.4.431) _loka_ has two meanings, namely

1. world [of phenomena]

2. world [of sensuous pleasure]

A bhikkhu may be free of one world but not the other. For example, if a bhikkhu
attains first jhāna, the Buddha says:

____
This, brahman, is called a bhikkhu who, having arrived at the end of the world
[of sensuous pleasure], abides at the end of the world [of sensuous pleasure]._

_Ayaṃ vuccati brāhmaṇā bhikkhu lokassa antaṃ āgamma lokassa ante
viharati._

(...) But some people say that he is nonetheless included in the world [of
phenomena], that he is nonetheless unliberated from the world [of phenomena]_

_Tamaññe evamāhaṃsu ayampi lokapariyāpanno ayampi anissaṭo lokamhā ti._

(...) I, too, say that he is nonetheless included in the world [of phenomena],
that he is nonetheless unliberated from the world [of phenomena]'_

_Ahampi brāhmaṇā evaṃ vadāmi ayampi lokapariyāpanno ayampi anissaṭo
lokamhā ti_
____

By translating _loka_ in these two ways, the meanings are clearly
distinguished, and the sutta makes sense. Although Bodhi recognises that _loka_
has two meanings (NDB n.1936), he translates it like this:

- This is called a bhikkhu who, having come to the end of the world, dwells at
the end of the world. Others say thus of him: 'He, too, is included in the
world; he, too, is not yet released from the world. I also say thus: 'He, too,
is included in the world; he, too, is not yet released from the world' (Bodhi,
NDB p.1304).

===== Rendering 'world [of beings]' as 'world'

We have seen that in pervading the whole world with a mind of [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill, 'world' means 'world [of beings].' But sometimes no
parenthesis is necessary. For example, consider these quotes where we use
rounded brackets where we consider the parenthesis is unnecessary:

[quote, S.3.83]
____
these beings are the foremost in the world (of beings), these are the best,
namely the arahants.

_ete aggā ete seṭṭhā lokasmiṃ yadidaṃ arahanto ti._
____

[quote, It.50]
____
those in the world (of beings) who have reached the Far Shore

_te ca pāragatā loke._
____

===== PED: profusion acknowledged

_Loka's_ profusion and complexity of meanings is acknowledged in PED, which
renders it as:

- 'world, primarily "visible world," then in general as "space or sphere of
creation" with various degrees of substantiality. Often (unspecified) in the
comprehensive sense of "universe." Sometimes the term is applied collectively
to the creatures inhabiting this or various other worlds, thus, "man, mankind,
people, beings."'

===== Imaṃ lokaṃ, paraṃ lokaṃ: two meanings

_Imaṃ lokaṃ, paraṃ lokaṃ_ has two potential meanings:

1. this world, and the world beyond

2. this [low] plane of existence, and the other planes beyond it

For example:

1. Having passed on from this world to the world beyond, how does one not
grieve?
+
****
_Asmā lokā paraṃ lokaṃ kathaṃ pecca na socati_ (Sn.v.185).
****

2. Beings roaming and wandering the round of birth and death [obstructed by]
uninsightfulness into reality, and [tethered to individual existence] by
craving, now go from this [low] plane of existence to the planes of existence
beyond it, now come from the planes of existence beyond it to this [low] plane
of existence.
+
****
_avijjānīvaraṇā sattā taṇhāsaṃyojanā sandhāvantā saṃsarantā
sakimpi asmā lokā paraṃ lokaṃ gacchanti sakimpi parasmā lokā imaṃ
lokaṃ āgacchanti_ (S.2.184-5).
****

===== Multi-universe system and planes of existence:

In the _Abhibhu Sutta_ (A.1.227) the Buddha calls himself immeasureable
(_appameyyā tathāgatā ti_), and says he can make his voice heard through the
billionfold multi-universe system (_tisahassī mahāsahassī lokadhātu_). This
implies that 1,000,000,000 is the number of universes in a multi-universe
system, though this is variable, as we will see.

Each universe has its own group of heavens, for example, one realm of the Four
Great Kings, one Tāvatiṃsā heaven etc.: _tasmiṃ sahassadhā loke...
cātummahārājikānaṃ sahassaṃ tāvatiṃsānaṃ sahassaṃ yāmānaṃ
sahassaṃ tusitānaṃ sahassaṃ nimmānaratīnaṃ sahassaṃ
paranimmitavasavattīnaṃ sahassaṃ brahmalokānaṃ_ (A.5.59).

There is apparently only one Buddha in a multi-universe system, because he and
his teachings are welcomed by 10,000 of them, and he is visited by devas from
the same number. This further suggests that 10,000 is the total number of
universes at present:

[quote, Vin.1.12]
____
And when the Blessed One had set rolling the Wheel of the Teaching... the ten
thousandfold multi-universe system trembled, quaked, and shook

_Pavattite ca pana bhagavatā dhammacakke... dasasahassī lokadhātu saṅkampi
sampakampi sampavedhi._
____

[quote, D.2.259]
____
'Bhikkhus, most of the gods from the ten thousandfold multi-universe system
have assembled...'

_yebhuyyena bhikkhave dasasu lokadhātūsu devatā sannipatitā honti...._
____

Each universe has only one earth, one sun, and one moon. Therefore seekers of
extra-terrestrial life will need to search outside our universe, not within it:
_tasmiṃ sahassadhā loke sahassaṃ candānaṃ sahassaṃ suriyānaṃ
sahassaṃ_ (A.5.59).

In each thousandfold multi-universe system Mahābrahmā ranks as foremost:
_yāvatā bhikkhave sahassīlokadhātu mahābrahmā tattha aggamakkhāyati_
(A.5.59). The prefix Mahā- is insignificant, because Mahābrahmā and Brahmā
are interchangeable. Therefore at present there is apparently space for just
ten Brahmās. Paccekabrahmās (e.g. S.1.146) are perhaps Brahmās without
multi-universe system sovereignty.

Each universe is comprised of three planes of existence (_dhātu_), which are
named according to two systems:

1. the low plane of existence, the middle plane of existence, and the high
plane of existence
+
****
_hīnadhātu majjhimadhātu paṇītadhātu_ (D.3.215), or,
****

2. the sensuous plane of existence, the refined material plane of existence,
and the immaterial plane of existence
+
****
_kāmadhātu... rūpadhātu... arūpadhātu_ (A.1.224).
****

Each universe has periods of contraction and expansion. This gives rise to two
sets of terms, either:

1. the universe contracts.
+
****
_loko saṃvaṭṭati._
****

2. the universe expands
+
****
_loko vivaṭṭati_ (D.1.17).
****

or:

1. the universal cycle is in its contracting phase
+
****
_kappo saṃvaṭṭati_
****

2. the universal cycle is in its expanding phase
+
****
_kappo vivaṭṭati_ (A.2.142).
****

The _Lokāyatika Brāhmaṇa Sutta_. See Introduction.

____
In the [terminology of the] Noble One's training system these five varieties of
sensuous pleasure are called 'the world [of sensuous pleasure].' Which five?

_Pañcime brāhmaṇā kāmaguṇā ariyassa vinaye loko ti vuccati katame
pañca?_

Visible objects known via the visual sense, likeable, loveable, pleasing,
agreeable, connected with sensuous pleasure, and charming. Audible objects
known via the auditory sense... smellable objects known via the olfactory
sense... Tasteable objects known via the gustatory sense... Tangible objects
known via the tactile sense, likeable, loveable, pleasing, agreeable, connected
with sensuous pleasure, and charming.

_Cakkhu viññeyyā rūpā iṭṭhā kantā manāpā piyarūpā
kāmūpasaṃhitā rajanīyā... kāya viññeyyā phoṭṭhabbā iṭṭhā
kantā manāpā piyarūpā kāmūpasaṃhitā rajanīyā. Ime kho brāhmaṇā
pañcakāmaguṇā ariyassa vinaye loko ti vuccati._

In this regard, brahman, a bhikkhu, secluded from sensuous pleasures and
spiritually unwholesome factors enters and abides in first jhāna, which is
accompanied by thinking and pondering, and rapture and physical pleasure born
of seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors].

_Idha brāhmaṇā bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi
savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ
upasampajja viharati._

This, brahman, is called a bhikkhu who

_Ayaṃ vuccati brāhmaṇā bhikkhu _

(...) having arrived at the end of the world [of sensuous pleasure]_

_lokassa antaṃ āgamma_

(...) abides at the end of the world [of sensuous pleasure]_

_lokassa ante viharati._

But some people say that he is nonetheless included in the world [of
phenomena], that he is nonetheless unliberated from the world [of phenomena]_

_Tamaññe evamāhaṃsu ayampi lokapariyāpanno ayampi anissaṭo lokamhā ti._

I, too, say that he is nonetheless included in the world [of phenomena], that
he is nonetheless unliberated from the world [of phenomena]_

_Ahampi brāhmaṇā evaṃ vadāmi ayampi lokapariyāpanno ayampi anissaṭo
lokamhā ti._
____

(...)

[quote, A.4.431]
____
Then again the bhikkhu, by completely transcending the state of awareness
neither having nor lacking perception, enters and abides in the ending of
perception and sense impression. And, by seeing [reality] with penetrative
discernment, his perceptually obscuring states are destroyed.

_Puna ca paraṃ brāhmaṇā bhikkhu sabbaso nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṃ
samatikkamma saññāvedayitanirodhaṃ upasampajja viharati. Paññāya cassa
disvā āsavā parikkhīṇā honti._

This is called a bhikkhu who,

_Ayaṃ vuccati brāhmaṇā bhikkhu_

(...) having arrived at the end of the world [of sensuous pleasure],

_lokassa antaṃ āgamma_

(...) abides at the end of the world [of sensuous pleasure],

_lokassa ante viharati_

(...) one who has overcome attachment to the world [of phenomena].

Venerable Ānanda said this:

[quote, S.4.95]
____
Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and entered his dwelling after
reciting a brief synopsis without explaining the meaning in detail, that is:

_Āyasmā ānando etadavoca yaṃ kho vo āvuso bhagavā saṅkhittena
uddesaṃ uddisitvā vitthārena atthaṃ avibhajitvā uṭṭhāyāsanā
vihāraṃ paviṭṭho_

'I declare that the end of the world [of phenomena] cannot be known, seen, or
reached by travelling.

_nāhaṃ bhikkhave gamanena lokassa antaṃ ñāteyyaṃ daṭṭheyyaṃ
patteyyanti vadāmi_

'And further I declare that without having reached the end of the world [of
phenomena] there is no putting an end to suffering'_

_na ca panāhaṃ bhikkhave appatvā lokassa antaṃ dukkhassa antakiriyaṃ
vadāmī ti._

This brief synopsis recited by the Blessed One, where the meaning was not
explained in detail, thus do I understand the meaning in detail.

_Imassa khvāhaṃ āvuso bhagavatā saṅkhittena uddesassa uddiṭṭhassa
vitthārena atthaṃ avibhattassa evaṃ vitthārena atthaṃ ājānāmi_

In the [terminology of the] Noble One's training system, that in the world [of
phenomena] via which one is a perceiver and conceiver of the world [of
phenomena] is called the world [of phenomena]

_Yena kho āvuso lokasmiṃ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī ayaṃ vuccati
ariyassa vinaye loko._

Via what in the world [of phenomena] is one a perceiver and conceiver of the
world [of phenomena]?

_Kena cāvuso lokasmiṃ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī?_

Via the visual sense in the world [of phenomena], is one a perceiver and
conceiver of the world [of phenomena]...

_cakkhunā kho āvuso lokasmiṃ lokasaññī hoti lokamānī..._

Via the mental sense in the world [of phenomena], is one a perceiver and

-- Is it possible, bhante, by travelling to know or to see or to reach the
end of the world [of phenomena], where one is not born, does not age, does not
die, does not pass away, and is not reborn?

_Yattha nu kho bhante na jāyati na jīyati na mīyati na cavati na uppajjati
sakkā nu kho so bhante gamanena lokassa anto ñātuṃ vā daṭṭhuṃ vā

-- As to that end of the world [of phenomena], friend, where one is not born,
does not age, does not die, does not pass away, and is not reborn: I declare
that it cannot be known, seen, or reached by travelling.

_Yattha kho āvuso na jāyati na jīyati na mīyati na cavati na uppajjati
nāhaṃ taṃ gamanena lokassa antaṃ ñāteyyaṃ daṭṭheyyaṃ

(...) However, friend, I declare that without having reached the end of the world
[of phenomena] there is no putting an end to suffering.

_na kho panāhaṃ āvuso appatvā lokassa antaṃ dukkhassa antakiriyaṃ

(...) It is, friend, in just this fathom-high carcass endowed with perception and
mind that I make known the world [of phenomena], the origination of the world
[of phenomena], the ending of the world [of phenomena], and the practice
leading to the ending of the world [of phenomena].

_Api cāhaṃ āvuso imasmiññeva vyāmamatte kaḷevare sasaññimhi samanake
lokañca paññāpemi lokasamudayañca lokanirodhañca lokanirodhagāminiñca

The end of the world [of phenomena] can never be reached by means of
travelling. +
Yet without reaching the end of the world [of phenomena] there is no freedom
from suffering.

_Gamanena na pattabbo lokassanto kudācanaṃ +
Na ca appatvā lokantaṃ dukkhā atthi pamocanaṃ._

Therefore, truly, one who knows the world [of phenomena] [according to
reality], one of great wisdom, one who has reached the end of the world [of
phenomena], fulfiller of the religious life, knowing the end of the world [of
phenomena] [according to reality], inwardly at peace, longs not for this world

In this regard, Ānanda, for whatever in the world [of phenomena] there is
clinging, grasping, obstinate adherence, stubborn attachment, and

=== Va jhayati

==== Renderings

- _Va jhayati_: he meditates [mindfully] indeed

- _Va jhayati_: he meditates [happily] indeed

==== Introduction

===== Va: three meanings

_Va_ is a shortened form occurring only in verse, says PED, as follows:

1. the shortened form of _iva_: 'like, like, as, as if'.

2. the shortened form for _eva_, which emphasises the word it follows, says
DOP, for example: 'that very..., the same..., exactly that..., only, merely,
just, indeed, really, certainly, absolutely, even, still'.

3. the shortened form of _vā_: 'or'.

Neither PED nor DOP say _va_ is ever redundant.

===== Va jhayati: he meditates mindfully or happily

The words _va jhayati_ occur 16 times in the suttas, 14 of which in the
_Theragāthā_. Often it is linked to another word. From the following three
examples we see that meditation in nature is done 'happily indeed.' Otherwise
it is done 'mindfully indeed.'

****
_sato va jhāyati_: he meditates mindfully indeed (Th.v.518-520).
****

[quote, Th.v.518]
____
When the wise man [sees that] old age and death, to which the ignorant Everyman
is attached, are existentially void, having profoundly understood existential
voidness, he meditates mindfully indeed. One does not find greater delight than
this.

_Yadā dukkhaṃ jarāmaraṇan ti paṇḍito aviddasū yattha sitā puthujjanā +
Dukkhaṃ pariññāya sato va jhāyati tato ratiṃ paramataraṃ na vindati._
____

****
_sumano va jhāyati_: he meditates happily indeed (Th.v.524).
****

[quote, Th.v.524]
____
When, seated on the banks of rivers full of flowers and beautifully garlanded
woodland plants, he meditates happily indeed, one does not find greater delight
than this.

_Yadā nadīnaṃ kusumākulānaṃ vicittavāneyyavaṭaṃsakānaṃ +
Tīre nisinno sumano va jhāyati tato ratiṃ paramataraṃ na vindati._
____

****
_bhaddova jhāyati_: he meditates happily indeed (Th.v.466).
****

[quote, Th.v.466]
____
In a woodland grove on the far side of Hog-plum Monastery, Bhaddiya, having
removed [the arrow of] craving together with its origin, meditates there
happily indeed.

_Pare ambāṭakārāme vanasaṇḍamhi bhaddiyo +
Samūlaṃ taṇhaṃ abbuyha tattha bhaddova jhāyati._
____

===== Va = ca: and

On one occasion we follow Norman in treating _va_ as _ca_ i.e. 'and free of
remissness...' Norman likewise says 'and': 'rid of distress and rid of
barreness of mind he meditates.'

[quote, Th.v.525]
____
When, having ended his own thinking and resorted to a cleft in the middle of
the mountains, he meditates free of suffering (_vītaddaro_) and (_va_) free of
remissness in practising the teaching (_vigatakhilo_), one does not find
greater delight than this.

_Yadā vitakke uparundhiyattano nagantare nagavivaraṃ samassito +
Vītaddaro vigatakhilo va jhāyati tato ratiṃ paramataraṃ na vindati._
____

===== Va = iva: mopes like

On one occasion, va _jhāyatī_ stands for _iva jhāyatī_, i.e. 'he mopes
like':

[quote, S.1.57]
____
So the fool, having left the teaching to follow a way opposed to the teaching,
mopes like [the carter] with a broken axle when he falls into the mouth of
Death.

_Evaṃ dhammā apakkamma adhammamanuvattiya +
Mando maccumukhaṃ patto akkhacchinno va jhāyatī ti._
____

For meanings of _jhāyati_ see Glossary sv _Jhāyati_.

===== The problematic forms

In the remaining cases, where _va_ emphasises _jhāyati_, it is not clear how
it should be emphasised. Norman uses the phrase 'meditates indeed,' which deals
with the problem without solving it. We choose to parenthesise and to follow
the context. As noted above, when meditation is in nature, we parenthesise
'[happily]'. For example:

[quote, Th.v.522]
____
When the thundercloud peals in the heavens, and the sky all around is full of
rain, and the bhikkhu meditates [happily] indeed in his mountain cave, one does
not find greater delight than this.

_Yadā nabhe gajjati meghadundubhi dhārākulā vihagapathe samantato +
Bhikkhū ca pabbhāragato va jhāyati tato ratiṃ paramataraṃ na vindati._
____

Where the meditation is not in nature, we parenthesise 'mindfully':

[quote, Th.v.892]
____
Having abandoned mother, father, sisters, brothers, and relatives; having
abandoned the five varieties of sensuous pleasure; Anuruddha meditates
[mindfully] indeed.

_Pahāya mātāpitaro bhaginī ñātibhātaro +
Pañcakāmaguṇe hitvā anuruddho va jhāyati._
____

==== Illustrations

====
va jhayati

mopes [mournfully] indeed; va jhayati, mopes like [the carter]
====

[quote, S.1.57]
____
As the carter who abandoned the highway, a road with an even surface, and
entered upon a rugged bypath, mopes [mournfully] indeed with a broken axle

_Yathā sākaṭiko patthaṃ samaṃ hitvā mahāpathaṃ +
Visamaṃ maggamāruyha akkhacchinno va jhāyati._

So the fool, having left the teaching to follow a way opposed to the teaching,
mopes like [the carter] with a broken axle when he falls into the mouth of
Death.

_Evaṃ dhammā apakkamma adhammamanuvattiya +
Mando maccumukhaṃ patto akkhacchinno va jhāyatī ti._
____

Comment:

The context of the first verse suggests _eva jhāyati_ and demands the
parenthesis of a word like 'mournfully': mopes [mournfully] indeed. As noted
above, the second suggests _iva jhāyati_: 'mopes like [the carter]'.

==== Introduction

===== Understanding the First Brahman Truth

Understanding the First Brahman Truth is challenged by the different meanings
of _vadhati_ which range from punish to destroy. This uncertainty is reflected
in translations of this Truth:

- Bodhi: All living beings are to be spared.

- Woodward: All living beings are not to be harmed.

We say 'destroyed':

[quote, A.2.176]
____
All beings ought not to be destroyed... In fully understanding the truth of
this saying one is applied to the practice of sympathy and tender concern for
beings.

_sabbe pāṇā avajjhā ti... Api ca yadeva tattha saccaṃ tadabhiññāya
pāṇānaṃ yeva anuddayāya anukampāya paṭipanno hoti._
____

===== Harming does not fit

One cannot say 'All beings ought not to be harmed,' because firstly, _vadhati_
does not mean 'to harm,' and secondly, harming is sometimes for beings'
benefit. For example:

[quote, A.3.6]
____
If a young infant through the negligence of the nurse puts a stick or stone
into its mouth, the nurse would quickly pay attention, and quickly remove it.
If she could not immediately remove it, then taking hold of the head with the
left hand, and crooking the finger of the right, would fetch it out even if she
drew blood. Why is this?

_salohitampi āhareyya taṃ kissa hetu_

(...) There would be some injury to the boy, I do not deny it. But, really, this
is what should be done by the nurse wishing for the child's well-being, seeking
its welfare, from tender concern, out of tender concern.

_atthesā bhikkhave kumārassa vihesā nesā natthīti vadāmi. Karaṇīyañca
kho etaṃ bhikkhave dhātiyā atthakāmāya hitesiniyā anukampikāya
anukampaṃ upādāya._
____

===== Striking does not fit

One cannot say 'All beings ought not to be struck,' for three reasons:

1. Firstly, although it is a pācittiya offence for a bhikkhu to strike a
bhikkhu in anger (_Yo pana bhikkhu bhikkhussa kupito anattamano pahāraṃ
dadeyya pācittiyan ti_, Vin.4.146), and a dukkaṭa offence to strike a
layperson, it no offence at all to strike an animal, and also no offence if,
being trapped in a difficult situation, a bhikkhu strikes a bhikkhu in order to
escape (_Anāpatti kenaci viheṭhiyamāno mokkhādhippāyo pahāraṃ deti_,
Vin.4.146).

2. Secondly, the Buddha, faced with a weak disciple, raised the possibility of
physical punishment:
+
[quote, Th.v.200]
____
'Don't go nodding, Ragamuffin, lest I strike you on the ear.'

_Mā kho tvaṃ kappaṭa pacalāyi mā tvaṃ upakaṇṇamhi tāḷessaṃ._
____

3. Thirdly, the Buddha battled with the fire-serpent in Kassapa's fire-chamber,
mastering his heat with heat, but without injuring his skin (_anupahacca
chaviñca_, Vin.1.25).
+
Striking is not necessarily unvirtuous.

===== Gerundives

The gerundive is passive in sense, and expresses suitability, fitness,
propriety, and may be translated by 'fit to be,' 'must be,' 'ought to be,' 'to
be' (PGPL, para.466).

=== Vanatha; Vana

==== Renderings

- _vanatha_: craving

- _vana_: craving

- _nibbanatha_: freedom from craving

- _nibbana_: freedom from craving

==== Introduction

===== Vana and vanatha: the negatives

The negatives of _vana_ and _vanatha_ are _nibbana_ and _nibbanatha_. See
quotes below.

===== Vanatha: controversy

The meaning of _vanatha_ [_vana+tha_] is unsettled. The primary meaning is
'underwood, brushwood, thicket.' In its figurative sense PED says 'lust,
desire.' Buddhaghosa says _kilesa_. Dhammapāla says _taṇhā_. For example:

- _Vanatho jāto_ (S.2.158). Commentary: _kilesavanaṃ jātaṃ_
(Buddhaghosa).

- _Vanathaṃ na kareyya kuhiñci_ (Th.v.1214). Commentary: _taṇhaṃ na
kareyyaṃ_ (Dhammapāla).

===== Vanatha means taṇhā

_Vanatha_ should be called _taṇhā_, not attachment, for two reasons:

1. the words _nibbanatho visallo_ occur together on two occasions, indicating
synonymity, (Th.v.525-6; S.1.180) where _visallo_ means 'free of the arrow of
_taṇhā_.' And if _nibbanatho_ (_nis+vanatha_) and _visallo_ are synonyms,
then so are _vanatha_ and _taṇhā_. See illustrations below.

2. In Sn.v.16 _vanatha_ is the basis of grasping. This again fits well with
calling it _taṇhā_ not attachment. See illustrations below.

===== Vana: controversy

_Vana_ has two meanings, _vana1_ (=Vedic _vana_) and _vana2_ (= _van_). The
former means 'jungle,' the latter means 'desire'. The two words are confused in
exegetical literature, says sharply critical PED:

- 'The Pāli (edifying) etymology clearly takes _vana1_ as belonging to
_vana2_, and dogmatically equals it with _vana2_ as an allegorical expression
('jungle') to _taṇhā_.'

What we said about _vanatha_ we can repeat with _vana_ (i.e. _vana2_). PED
repeats its position on _vanatha_ (i.e. 'lust, desire'), but the commentators
now switch. Dhammapāla says _kilesa,_ and Buddhaghosa says _taṇhā_:

- _Nibbano_ (Sn.v.1131): _kilesavanavirahito taṇhāvirahito eva vā_
(Buddhaghosa).

- _Vanādhimutto_ (Dh.v.344): _taṇhāvanā mutto_ (Buddhaghosa).

- _Vanā_ (Th.v.691): _kilesavanato_ (Dhammapāla).

===== Vana and vanatha: synonyms

The following quotes treat _vana_ and _vanatha_ (= _banatha_) as synonyms:

=== Vavakaṭṭha; Vūpakaṭṭha

==== Renderings

- _vūpakaṭṭha_: withdrawn

- _kāyavūpakāsena vūpakaṭṭho_: physically withdrawn [from human
fellowship]

- _gaṇasmā vūpakaṭṭho_: withdrawn from human fellowship

- _cittavūpakāsena vūpakaṭṭho_: psychologically withdrawn [from

- _vūpakaṭṭha_: withdrawn [from human fellowship, sensuous pleasures, and
spiritually unwholesome factors]

- _vavakaṭṭhaṃ cittaṃ hoti_: psychologically withdrawn [from sensuous
pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors]

==== Introduction

===== Vavakaṭṭha and vūpakaṭṭha

_Vavakaṭṭha_ and _vūpakaṭṭha_ are past participles from _vavakassati_.
_Vūpakaṭṭha_ is possibly a 're-translation' of _vavakaṭṭha_, says PED.
The words are identical in meaning, and interchangeable:

- _cittena vivekapoṇena vivekapabbhārena vavakaṭṭhena_ (A.4.233).

- _cittena vivekapoṇena vivekapabbhārena vūpakaṭṭhena_ (M.3.111).

But there is a difference: _Vavakaṭṭha_ is rare, occurring just 5 times in
the suttas, always with _citta_. _Vūpakaṭṭha_ occurs 133 times in a
variety of contexts.

===== Vivekakaṭṭha: error

We follow Bodhi in reading _vavakaṭṭha_ for _vivekakaṭṭha_ (NDB n.1687;
n.1694, re passages at A.4.224 and A.4.233). He says that 'since compounds with
_viveka_ precede this word, it is easy to see how the original word could have
undergone mutation.' The sequence at A.4.224 is: _vivekaninnaṃ cittaṃ hoti
vivekapoṇaṃ vivekapabbhāraṃ vavakaṭṭhaṃ_.

===== Vapakassati: error

PED says _vapakassati_ (A.3.393-4) should read _vavakassati_.

===== Vavakassati and vavakāsituṃ: their objects

_Vavakassati_ and its infinitive _vavakāsituṃ_ either have an explicit
object, or an object that can be easily identified from context:

1. When he lives apart from the Teacher or a companion in the religious life of
the standing of a teacher
+
****
_Yato ca kho so vavakassateva satthārā vavakassati garuṭṭhānīyehi
sabrahmacārihi_... (A.3.393).
****

3. On what grounds is there schism in the community of bhikkhus? Bhikkhus
proclaim what is not the teaching to be the teaching, and visa versa... On
these ten grounds they [legalistically] withdraw and separate [from the
resident community of bhikkhus]. They perform legal acts separately and recite
the Pātimokkha separately. It is in this way, Upāli, that there is schism in
the community of bhikkhus.

===== Vūpakaṭṭho: its objects

The two kinds of 'withdrawal' are 1) of body and 2) of mind, as the following
quote shows:

[quote, S.5.67]
____
When one has heard the teaching from [excellent] bhikkhus one dwells withdrawn
in two ways: physically withdrawn [from human fellowship], and psychologically
withdrawn [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors].

_tathārūpānaṃ bhikkhave bhikkhūnaṃ dhammaṃ sutvā dvayena
vūpakaṭṭho viharati kāyavūpakāsena ca cittavūpakāsena ca._
____

===== Kāyavūpakāsa: source of its parenthesis

Where necessary, we parenthesise _kāyavūpakāsa_ ('physically withdrawn [from
human fellowship]') in accordance with the following quote:

[quote, M.3.110]
____
A bhikkhu dwells alone, withdrawn from human fellowship.

_bhikkhu eko gaṇasmā vūpakaṭṭho viharati._
____

===== Cittavūpakāsa: source of its parenthesis

We parenthesise _cittavūpakāsa_ ('psychologically withdrawn [from sensuous
pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors]') in accordance with the
following quotes:

1. A certain bhikkhu who had gone for his daytime abiding in a woodland grove
'kept thinking unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome thoughts associated with the
household life.'
+
****
_so bhikkhu divāvihāragato pāpake akusale vitakke vitakketi gehanissite_
(S.1.197).
****

2. Those ascetics and Brahmanists who live physically withdrawn from sensuous
pleasures but whose hankering, love, infatuation, thirst, and passion for
sensuous pleasures has not been fully abandoned and quelled internally... are
incapable of knowledge and vision [of things according to reality], and supreme
enlightenment.
+
****
_ye hi keci samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā kāyena ceva kāmehi
vūpakaṭṭhā viharanti yo ca nesaṃ kāmesu kāmacchando kāmasneho
kāmamucchā kāmapipāsā kāmapariḷāho so ca ajjhattaṃ na suppahīno
hoti na suppaṭippassaddho... abhabbāva te ñāṇāya dassanāya anuttarāya
sambodhāya_ (M.1.241).
****

3. Secluded from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors, a
bhikkhu enters and abides in first jhāna, which is accompanied by thinking and
pondering, and rapture and physical pleasure born of seclusion [from sensuous
pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors].
+
****
_Idhāvuso visākha bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi
savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ
upasampajja viharati_ (M.1.301).
****

===== Vūpakaṭṭha: with no object

When _vūpakaṭṭha_ has no explicit object, the considerations above show
that it is a combination of _kāyavūpakāsa_ and _cittavūpakāsa_, therefore
needs a combination of their parentheses:

[quote, S.4.145]
____
Bhante, it would be good if the Blessed One would explain the teaching to me in
brief, so that, having heard the teaching from the Blessed One, I might abide
alone, withdrawn [from human fellowship, sensuous pleasures, and spiritually
unwholesome factors], diligently, vigorously, and resolutely applied [to the
practice].

_sādhu me bhante bhagavā saṅkhittena dhammaṃ desetu yamahaṃ bhagavato
dhammaṃ sutvā eko vūpakaṭṭho appamatto ātāpī pahitatto vihareyyanti._
____

===== Vūpakaṭṭha, viveka, and paviveka: a comparison

_Viveka_ applies to the mind, and means seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and
spiritually unwholesome factors]. _Paviveka_ means physical seclusion.
_Vūpakaṭṭha_, if unqualified, means _viveka_ plus _paviveka_. See Glossary
sv _Viveka_ and sv _Paviveka_.

===== Physical seclusion implies the striving for mental seclusion

That the Buddha regarded living secludedly (_pavivitta_) to be inseparably
linked to the development of seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually
unwholesome factors] (_viveka_) is discussed sv _Paviveka_.

===== Vavakaṭṭhaṃ: assigning its object

_Vavakaṭṭha_ always has the same explicit object. So, in its five
occurrences it has only one meaning:

- _Vavakaṭṭhaṃ cittaṃ hoti_: psychologically withdrawn [from sensuous
pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors]

==== Illustrations

gaṇasmā vūpakaṭṭho

[quote, A.4.436]
____
'At present I am living crowded by bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs, by male and female
lay followers, by kings and royal ministers, by non-Buddhist ascetics and their
disciples.

_ahaṃ kho etarahi ākiṇṇo viharāmi bhikkhūhi bhikkhunīhi upāsakehi
upāsikāhi raññā rājamahāmattehi titthiyehi titthiyasāvakehi._

How about if I lived alone, withdrawn from human fellowship?

_Yannūnāhaṃ eko gaṇasmā vūpakaṭṭho vihareyyanti._

He resorts to a secluded abode: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a
grotto, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a quiet grove, the open air, a heap
of straw.

_So vivittaṃ senāsanaṃ bhajati araññaṃ rukkhamūlaṃ pabbataṃ

In this regard, the bhikkhu living secludedly may be visited by bhikkhus,
bhikkhunīs, laymen, laywomen, kings and kings' ministers, and non-Buddhist
ascetics and their disciples.

_idha bhikkhave bhikkhuno pavivittassa viharato bhavanti upasaṅkamitāro
bhikkhū bhikkhūniyo upāsakā upāsikāyo rājāno rājamahāmattā titthiyā

In that case, the bhikkhu, mentally inclining, verging, and drifting towards
seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors],
psychologically withdrawn [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome
factors], taking delight in the practice of unsensuousness, is one whose words
are exclusively connected with religious inspiration.

=== Vasala

==== Renderings

- _vasala_: wretch

- _vasali_: wretched woman

- _vasala_: wretched

==== Introduction

===== On insulting non-brahmans

_Vasala_ literally means 'little man' (PED). It was a term of abuse used by
brahmans in reference to members of other social groups. For example, when
Aggika Bhāradvāja saw the Blessed One coming in the distance, he shouted:

____
'Stop, you! Right there, shaveling! Right there, sham ascetic! Right there,
wretch!

_tatreva muṇḍaka tatreva samaṇaka tatreva vasalaka tiṭṭhāhī ti._
____

===== On insulting other brahmans

Brahmans also used it to insult other brahmans. For example, when a brahman's
wife praised the Buddha, the brahman said (of his own wife!):

[quote, S.1.160]
____
On the slightest pretext this wretched woman spouts praise of that shaveling
ascetic!

_evamevaṃ panāyaṃ vasali yasmiṃ vā tasmiṃ vā tassa muṇḍakassa
samaṇassa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsati._
____

===== On insulting one's own posterior

Brahmans used it to insult their own bodies:

[quote, Vin.2.221]
____
Now at that time a certain bhikkhu who had been born a brahman, having
defaecated, did not want to rinse himself, thinking: 'Who would touch this
wretched, stinking thing?' A worm remained in his anus.

_Tena kho pana samayena aññataro bhikkhu brāhmaṇa jātiko vaccaṃ katvā
na icchati ācametuṃ ko imaṃ vasalaṃ duggandhaṃ āmasissatīti. Tassa
vaccamagge kimi saṇṭhāsi._
____

===== No castes, no outcastes

Caste is 'one of the hereditary social classes in Hinduism that restrict the
occupation of their members and the association with the members of other
castes' (Webster's).

The four classes of the Buddha's time were therefore not technically castes
because intermarriage was still possible (D.1.97). Marriage to even low-class
women was common amongst brahmans (A.3.229). Queen Mallika was King Pasenadi's
wife, though her father was a garland-maker.

So _vasala_ cannot mean 'outcaste'.

=== Vicikicchā

==== Renderings

- _vicikicchā_: doubt [about the significance of the teaching]

- _vicikicchati_: to be doubtful [about the perfection of the Perfect One's
transcendent insight]

- _vicikicchati_: to be doubtful [about the perfection of the Blessed One's
body]

- _satthari vicikicchati_: to be doubtful about the [perfection of the]
Teacher's [transcendent insight]

- _dhamme vicikicchati_: to be doubtful about the [significance of the] teaching

- _saṅghe vicikicchati_: to be doubtful about the [praiseworthiness of the]
community of disciples' [application to the practice]

- _sikkhāya vicikicchati_: to be doubtful about the [significance of the]
training

- _vicikicchākathaṅkathāsallaṃ_: the arrow of doubt and uncertainty
[about the significance of the teaching]

- _vicikicchākathaṅkathāsallaṃ_: the arrow of doubt and uncertainty
[about the way of spiritual fulfilment, and of unfulfilment]

==== Introduction

===== The four words for doubt

There are four words for doubt:

1. _vicikicchā_: doubt

2. _kaṅkhā_: unsureness

3. _kathaṅkathā_: uncertainty

4. _vimati_: uncertainty

===== Classical objects of doubt

The classical objects of doubt are the Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha, and the
training. Our renderings for these are as follows, with explanations to follow:

- Buddha: doubt about the [perfection of the] Perfect One's [transcendent
insight]

- Dhamma: doubt about the [significance of the] teaching

- Saṅgha: doubt about the [praiseworthiness of the] community of disciples'
[application to the practice]

- The training: doubt about the [significance of the] training

===== Doubt about the [perfection of the] Buddha's [transcendent insight]

A noble disciple who has unshakeable faith in the Buddha (_ariyasāvako buddhe
aveccappasādena samannāgato hoti_) has come to the conclusion that:

[quote, S.5.390]
____
He is indeed the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One,
perfect in insightfulness into reality and in conduct, the Sublime One, one who
knows the world [of phenomena] [according to reality], the unexcelled trainer
of men to be tamed, the teacher of devas and men, the Enlightened One, the
Blessed One.

_iti pi so bhagavā arahaṃ sammā sambuddho vijjācaraṇasampanno sugato
lokavidu anuttaro purisadammasārathī satthā devamanussānaṃ buddho
bhagavā ti._
____

According to this, the noble disciple's faith is not in the person of the
Buddha, but in the perfection of his transcendent insight. This is in
accordance with the definition of _saddhindriyaṃ_ which is linked to
_tathāgatassa bodhiṃ_:

[quote, S.5.196]
____
And what is the faculty of faith? In this regard, the noble disciple has faith.
He has faith in the [perfection of the] Perfect One's transcendent insight: 'He
is indeed the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, perfect
in insightfulness into reality and in conduct, the Sublime One, one who knows
the world [of phenomena] [according to reality], the unexcelled trainer of men
to be tamed, the teacher of devas and men, the Enlightened One, the Blessed
One.'

_Katamañca bhikkhave saddhindriyaṃ idha bhikkhave ariyasāvako saddho hoti
saddahati tathāgatassa bodhiṃ iti pi so bhagavā arahaṃ sammāsambuddho
vijjācaraṇasampanno sugato lokavidū anuttaro purisadammasārathī satthā
devamanussānaṃ buddho bhagavā ti. Idaṃ vuccati bhikkhave saddhindriyaṃ._
____

Therefore doubt about the Buddha would mean 'doubt about the [perfection of
the] Buddha's [transcendent insight].'

===== Doubt about the [significance of the] teaching

A noble disciple who has unshakeable faith in the teaching (_ariyasāvako
dhamme aveccappasādena samannāgato hoti_) has come to the conclusion that:

[quote, S.5.390]
____
The teaching is well explained by the Blessed One, fathomable in this
lifetime, realisable in the here and now, intriguing, personally applicable, to
be realised by the wise for themselves.

_svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo sandiṭṭhiko akāliko ehipassiko opanayiko
paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhī ti_
____

In the light of these qualities, the teaching's excellence and effectiveness,
doubt about the Dhamma means 'doubt about the [significance of the] teaching.'

===== Doubt about the [praiseworthiness of the] community of disciples' [application to the practice]

A noble disciple who has unshakeable faith in the community of disciples
(_ariyasāvako saṅghe aveccappasādena samannāgato hoti_) has come to the
conclusion that:

[quote, S.5.390]
____
The community of the Blessed One's disciples is applied to an excellent
practice, is applied to the correct practice, is applied to the noble practice,
is applied to a proper practice; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight
types of individuals. This community of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy
of offerings, hospitality, gifts, and honouring with joined palms. They are the
unsurpassed field of merit for the world.

_supaṭipanno bhagavato sāvakasaṅgho ujupaṭipanno bhagato
sāvakasaṅgho ñāyapaṭipanno bhagavato sāvakasaṅgho sāmīcipaṭipanno
bhagavato sāvakasaṅgho yadidaṃ cattāri purisayugāni
aṭṭhapurisapuggalā esabhagavato sāvakasaṅgho āhuneyyo pāhuneyyo
dakkhiṇeyyo añjalikaraṇīyo anuttaraṃ puññakkhettaṃ lokassāti._
____

'Unshakeable faith in the community of disciples' is therefore not primarily
faith in the members of the community, but in the praiseworthiness of their
application to the practice. Therefore doubt about the Saṅgha would mean
'doubt about the [praiseworthiness of the] community of disciples' [application
to the practice].'

===== Doubt about the [significance of the] training

The fourth area of doubt concerns 'the training' (_sikkhāya kaṅkhati
vicikicchati_ (A.3.249). But what is doubtful about the training? The
scriptures say:

[quote, A.2.243]
____
This religious life is lived for the sake of a benefit from the training...
to inspire faith in those without faith, and to increase the faith of those
with faith... for the complete destruction of suffering.

_Sikkhānisaṃsamidaṃ bhikkhave brahmacariyaṃ vussati...
appasannānaṃ pasādāya pasannānaṃ bhiyyobhāvāya... sabbaso sammā
dukkhakkhayāya._
____

Therefore, in relation to the training, doubt would mean 'doubt about the
[significance of the] training.'

===== Doubt about the [significance of the] Path and the practice

With the Path (_magga_) and practice (_paṭipadā_), we also render them in
terms of 'significance':

[quote, D.2.155]
____
The Perfect One, Ānanda, has the actual knowledge that there is not one
bhikkhu in this assembly of bhikkhus who is unsure or uncertain about the
[perfection of the] Buddha's [transcendent insight], or about the [significance
of the] teaching, or about the [praiseworthiness of the] community of
disciples' [application to the practice], or about the [significance of the]
Path and the practice.

_ñāṇameva hettha ānanda tathāgatassa natthi imasmiṃ bhikkhu saṅghe
ekabhikkhussāpi kaṅkhā vā vimati vā buddhe vā dhamme vā saṅghe vā
magge vā paṭipadāya vā._
____

===== Unspecified doubt in the scriptures

Often the scriptures do not specify the object of doubt, whether it means doubt
about the Buddha, or the teachings, or the community of disciples, or the
training. However, most contexts suggest that unspecified doubt refers to the
teachings, and there is definite evidence for this, too, as follows:

1. The second of the five ties to individual existence in the low plane of
existence (_pañcorambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni_) is usually called unspecified
_vicikicchā_ (D.3.234). But in the _Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta_, this unspecified
doubt is plainly linked to the teachings:
+
[quote, M.1.433]
____
A young infant does not have the notion 'teachings' (_dhammā ti pi na hoti_),
so how could doubt about the [significance of the] teachings arise in him? Yet
the proclivity to it lurks within him

_dhammā ti pi na hoti. Kuto panassa uppajjissati dhammesu vicikicchā
anusetitvevassa vicikicchānusayo._
____

2. The fifth of the five hindrances is usually called unspecified
_vicikicchā_, but when the bhikkhu in the _Upajjhāya Sutta_ experienced
doubt, he linked it to the teachings, _dhammesu vicikicchā_:
+
[quote, A.3.69]
____
Bhante, my body now seems as if drugged. I have lost my bearings. The teachings
do not occur to my mind. Lethargy and torpor plague my mind. I live the
celibate life disgruntled. I am doubtful about the [significance of the]
teaching (_dhammesu vicikicchā_)

_etarahi me bhante madhurakajāto ceva kāyo. Disā ca me na pakkhāyanti.
Dhammā ca maṃ nappaṭibhanti. Thīnamiddhañca me cittaṃ pariyādāya
tiṭṭhati. Anabhirato ca brahmacariyaṃ carāmi. Atthi ca me dhammesu
vicikicchā ti._
____

3. In several suttas doubt is openly linked to _saddhamma_:
+
[quote, S.3.99]
____
The ignorant Everyman... is unsure, doubtful, undecided about the
[significance of the] true teaching (_saddhamme_).

_assutavā puthujjano... kaṅkhī hoti vicikicchī aniṭṭhaṅgato saddhamme._
____
+
[quote, A.2.174]
____
Some person here is unsure, doubtful, undecided about the [significance of the]
true teaching (_saddhamme_).

_Puna ca paraṃ brāhmaṇa idhekacco kaṅkhī hoti vicikicchī
aniṭṭhaṅgato saddhamme._
____

4. Because all aspects of faith stem from faith in the teachings (see following
quotes), doubt in the teachings necessarily implies doubt in all objects of
faith. Therefore doubt in the teachings is effectively the all-embracing term,
and can be used as such when the object of doubt is unspecified. That faith in
the teachings is the basis of other aspects of faith is shown in these quotes:
+
[quote, M.1.179]
____
On hearing the teaching he acquires faith in the [perfection of the] Perfect
One's [transcendent insight]

_So taṃ dhammaṃ sutvā tathāgate saddhaṃ paṭilabhati._
____
+
[quote, M.1.320]
____
As the Blessed One explained the teaching to me with its increasingly higher
and more sublime levels, concerning what is inwardly dark and bright with their
correlative combinations, thus through transcendent insight into a certain one
of those teachings, I came to a conclusion about the teachings. I gained faith
in the Teacher thus: "The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened. The teaching is
well explained by the Blessed One. The community of disciples is applied to an
excellent practice."

_Yathā yathā me āvuso bhagavā dhammaṃ deseti uttaruttariṃ
paṇītapaṇītaṃ kaṇhasukkasappaṭibhāgaṃ tathā tathāhaṃ
tasmiṃ dhamme abhiññāya idhekaccaṃ dhammaṃ dhammesu
niṭṭhamagamaṃ satthari pasīdiṃ sammā sambuddho bhagavā svākkhāto
bhagavatā dhammo supaṭipanno saṅgho ti._
____
+
[quote, A.5.115]
____
Faith [in the perfection of the Perfect One's transcendent insight] has a
nourishing condition, I declare, not no nourishing condition. And what is the
condition that nourishes it? Listening to the true teaching, one should reply.

_Saddhampahaṃ bhikkhave sāhāraṃ vadāmi saddhammasavanantissa
vacanīyaṃ._
____

===== Two areas of doubt [about the significance of the teaching]: internal things and external things

The hindrance of doubt is twofold:

1. Doubt [about the significance of the teaching] in relation to internal
things is a spiritual hindrance.
+
****
_Yadapi bhikkhave ajjhattaṃ dhammesu vicikicchā tadapi nīvaraṇaṃ_
****

2. Doubt [about the significance of the teaching] in relation to external
things is also a spiritual hindrance.
+
****
_Yadapi bahiddhā dhammesu vicikicchā tadapi nīvaraṇaṃ_
****

[quote, S.5.110]
____
Thus what is concisely called the hindrance of doubt [about the significance of
the teaching] becomes twofold by this method of exposition.

_Vicikicchā nīvaraṇanti itihidaṃ uddesaṃ gacchati tadamināpetaṃ
pariyāyena dvayaṃ hoti._
____

===== Vicikicchā saṃyojana and nīvaraṇa: what is the difference?

_Vicikicchā saṃyojana_ is abandoned at stream-entry. _Vicikicchā
nīvaraṇa_ is abandoned at arahantship. We call both terms 'doubt [about the
significance of the teaching].' What is the difference?

1. _Vicikicchā saṃyojana_ is a powerful form of doubt that is a tie to
individual existence in the low plane of existence:
+
[quote, M.1.434]
____
The ignorant Everyman abides with a mind absorbed in and overcome by doubt
[about the significance of the teaching]. He does not discern according to
reality the deliverance from the arisen doubt [about the significance of the
teaching]. When that doubt [about the significance of the teaching] is powerful
and unsubdued in him, it is a tie to individual existence in the low plane of
existence.

_vicikicchāpariyuṭṭhitena cetasā viharati vicikicchāparetena. Uppannāya
ca vicikicchāya nissaraṇaṃ yathābhūtaṃ nappajānāti. Tassa sā
vicikicchā thāmagatā appaṭivinītā orambhāgiyaṃ saṃyojanaṃ._
____

2. _Vicikicchā nīvaraṇa_ is a less powerful form of doubt that lingers till
arahantship. Whereas arahants have abandoned the five hindrances so that they
are chopped down at the root, completely and irreversibly destroyed, never to
arise again in future (_pahīnā ucchinnamūlā tālāvatthukatā
anabhāvakatā āyatiṃ anuppādadhammā_ S.5.327), disciples in training are
still in the process of abandoning them (_nīvaraṇe pahāya viharanti_,
S.5.327).

===== Purification of doubt and perfection of faith

The purification of doubt corresponds to an increasing faith which reaches
perfection at arahantship. At levels below arahantship, the faculties,
including the faculty of faith, are weaker, implying that doubt is stronger:

[quote, S.5.200]
____
One who has completed and fulfilled the five spiritual faculties is an arahant.
If they are weaker than that, one is a non-returner; if still weaker, a
once-returner; if still weaker, a stream-enterer.

_Imesaṃ kho bhikkhave pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ samattā paripūrattā
arahaṃ hoti. Tato mudutarehi anāgāmī hoti. Tato mudutarehi sakadāgāmī
hoti. Tato mudutarehi sotāpanno hoti._
____

Although _aveccappasāda_ is associated with stream-entry, and with the phrase
'The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened,' the _Cūḷahatthipadopama Sutta_
says one cannot in fact conclude that the Blessed One is perfectly enlightened
until arahantship:

[quote, M.1.184]
____
And it is not until this point that a noble disciple can come to the
conclusion: 'The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened; the teaching is well
explained by the Blessed One; the community of the Blessed One's disciples is
applied to an excellent practice.'

_Ettāvatā kho brāhmaṇa ariyasāvako niṭṭhaṃ gato hoti
sammāsambuddho bhagavā svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo supaṭipanno bhagavato
sāvakasaṅgho ti._
____

===== Doubt: what are the consequences?

The scriptures say that if one is unsure, doubtful, undecided about, and has no
faith in

- the [perfection of the] Teacher's [transcendent insight]

- the [significance of the] teaching

- the [praiseworthiness of the] community of disciples' [application to the
practice]

- the [significance of the] training

[quote, D.3.237]
____
then one's mind does not incline to vigour, application, perseverance, and
inward striving.

_idhāvuso bhikkhu satthari... dhamme... saṅghe... sikkhāya... kaṅkhati
vicikicchati nādhimuccati na sampasīdati... tassa cittaṃ na namati
ātappāya anuyogāya sātaccāya padhānāya. Yassa cittaṃ na namati
ātappāya anuyogāya sātaccayā padhānāya._
____

[quote, S.5.410]
____
In contrast, Venerable Sāriputta said a noble disciple who has faith [in
the perfection of the Perfect One's transcendent insight] will dwell
energetically applied to the abandoning of spiritually unwholesome factors and
the undertaking of spiritually wholesome factors; that he will be steadfast,
unwavering in application [to the practice], not shirking the responsibility of
[undertaking] spiritually wholesome factors.

_Saddhassa hi bhante ariyasāvakassa etaṃ pāṭikaṅkhaṃ: yaṃ
āraddhaviriyo viharissati akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ pahānāya kusalānaṃ
dhammānaṃ upasampadāya thāmavā daḷhaparakkamo anikkhittadhuro kusalesu
dhammesu._
____

[quote, S.5.398]
____
Sometimes a noble disciple might abide negligently applied [to the practice]
(_ariyasāvako pamādavihārī hoti_). Although he has unshakeable faith in the
Buddha and the teaching, he is content with that faith, and does not make
further effort for physical seclusion by day nor for solitary retreat at night.

_aveccappasādena santuṭṭho na uttariṃ vāyamati divā pavivekāya
rattiṃ paṭisallānāya._
____

According to Venerable Sāriputta's statement, this negligence is due to a
relative lack of faith, or in other words, the fifth hindrance, doubt [about
the significance of the teaching]. Thus, even amongst stream-enterers, some
have stronger faith than others, which can be seen in their levels of diligence.

===== Cause of doubt about the significance of the teaching: craving

Doubt about the significance of the teaching comes from craving (_taṇhā_):

[quote, S.3.99]
____
The ignorant Everyman... is unsure, doubtful, undecided about the
[significance of the] true teaching.

_assutavā puthujjano... kaṅkhī hoti vicikicchī aniṭṭhaṅgato
saddhamme_

(...) That unsureness, doubt, and undecidedness about the [significance of the]
true teaching is an originated phenomenon.

_yā kho pana sā bhikkhave kaṅkhitā vicikicchitā aniṭṭhaṅgatatā
saddhamme saṅkhāro so._

(...) What is the basis, origin, object of genesis and production of that
originated phenomenon?

_So pana saṅkhāro kinnidāno kiṃsamudayo kiñjātiko kimpabhavoti_

(...) When the ignorant Everyman is affected by sense impression born of
sensation and uninsightfulness into reality, craving arises.

_avijjāsamphassajena bhikkhave vedayitena phuṭṭhassa assutavato
puthujjanassa uppannā taṇhā_

(...) That originated phenomenon is born from that

_tatojo so saṅkhāro._

===== Cause of doubt about the significance of the teaching: improper contemplation

[quote, A.1.4]
____
I do not see any one thing on account of which unarisen doubt [about the
significance of the teaching] arises, and arisen doubt [about the significance
of the teaching] increases and expands, as improper contemplation.

_Nāhaṃ bhikkhave aññaṃ ekadhammampi samanupassāmi yena anuppannā vā
vicikicchā uppajjati uppannā vā vicikicchā bhiyyobhāvāya vepullāya

For one of improper contemplation, unarisen doubt [about the significance of
the teaching] arises, and arisen doubt [about the significance of the teaching]
increases and expands.

_Ayoniso bhikkhave manasikaroto anuppannā ceva vicikicchā uppajjati uppannā

____

[quote, A.1.4-5]
____
I do not see any one thing on account of which unarisen doubt [about the
significance of the teaching] does not arise, and arisen doubt [about the
significance of the teaching] is abandoned, as proper contemplation.

_Nāhaṃ bhikkhave aññaṃ ekadhammampi samanupassāmi yena anuppannā vā

===== Overcoming doubt about the significance of the teaching by meditation

[quote, Ud.60]
____
Any unsureness [about the significance of the teaching] in relation to what is
experienced by oneself or by others, either here or in the world beyond, is
completely abandoned by those who meditate, by those who are vigorously applied
[to the practice], by those who live the religious life

===== Overcoming doubt about the significance of the teaching by overcoming self-centredness

The _Nissāraṇīya Sutta_ (A.3.291-2) says doubt [about the significance of
the teaching] persists as long as the notion "I am" has not vanished, which
happens at arahantship (S.3.131). So, although the scriptures say that to enter
first jhāna the five hindrances must first be suppressed (M.3.136; D.1.204),
this can be only relatively true. According to the _Nissāraṇīya Sutta_, the
hindrance of doubt is not properly suppressed before arahantship. Of course,
this relative impurity of jhāna is maybe true for all five hindrances.

[quote, D.3.250]
____
If the notion "I am" has vanished, and one does not regard anything as "[in
reality] what I am,"' it is impossible, out of the question, that the arrow of
doubt and uncertainty [about the significance of the teaching] would plague
your mind.

_aṭṭhānametaṃ āvuso anavakāso yaṃ asmī ti vigate ayamahamasmī ti
asamanupassato atha ca panassa vicikicchākathaṅkathāsallaṃ cittaṃ
pariyādāya ṭhassatī ti._
____

However, according to the _Cūḷasaccaka Sutta_, doubt about the significance
of the teaching can be suppressed before arahantship by contemplating the
voidness of personal qualities [in the five aggregates], as follows:

____
-- On what grounds is a disciple of Master Gotama one who practises his
training system, who responds to his advice, who has overcome doubt [about the
significance of the teaching] (_tiṇṇavicikiccho_), one who is free of
uncertainty [about the significance of the teaching] (_vigatakathaṅkatho_),
who has gained confidence [in the teaching], and abides no longer dependent on
others regarding the [understanding of the] Teacher's training system?

_Kittāvatā nu kho bhoto gotamassa sāvako sāsanakaro hoti ovādapatikaro
tiṇṇavicikiccho vigatakathaṅkatho vesārajjappatto aparappaccayo
satthusāsane viharatī ti_

-- A disciple of mine sees each of the five aggregates according to reality
with perfect penetrative discernment: This is "not [in reality] mine," this is
"not [in reality] what I am," this is "not my [absolute] Selfhood"

_Idha aggivessana mama sāvako yaṃ kiñci rūpaṃ... viññāṇaṃ
atītānāgata paccuppannaṃ ajjhattaṃ vā bahiddhā vā oḷārikaṃ vā

viññāṇaṃ n'etaṃ mama n'eso'hamasmi na me so attā ti evametaṃ
yathābhūtaṃ sammappaññāya passati_

-- On what grounds is a bhikkhu an arahant with perceptually obscuring states
destroyed, one who has fulfilled [the religious life], done what had to be
done, laid down the burden, achieved his objective, destroyed the ties to
individual existence, and is liberated [from perceptually obscuring states]
through the complete knowledge [of things according to reality]?

_Kittāvatā pana bho gotama bhikkhu arahaṃ hoti khīṇāsavo vusitavā
katakaraṇīyo ohitabhāro anuppattasadattho parikkhīṇabhavasaṃyojano

-- In this regard, having seen any kind of bodily form... advertence according
to reality with perfect penetrative discernment as "not [in reality] mine,"
"not [in reality] what I am," "not my [absolute] Selfhood," a bhikkhu is
liberated [from perceptually obscuring states] through being without grasping.

_Idha aggivessana bhikkhu yaṃ kiñci rūpaṃ atītānāgata paccuppannaṃ
ajjhattaṃ vā bahiddhā vā oḷārikaṃ vā sukhumaṃ vā hīnaṃ vā
paṇītaṃ vā yaṃ dūre sannike vā sabbaṃ rūpaṃ n'etaṃ mama

_Yā kāci vedanā... saññā... saṅkhārā... viññāṇaṃ..._ (M.1.235).

===== Overcoming doubt about the significance of the teaching: seeing with penetrative discernment

____
-- Bhikkhus, is doubt [about the significance of the teaching] abandoned in one
who perceives according to reality with perfect penetrative discernment: 'This
is brought about'?

_Bhūtamidan ti bhikkhave yathābhūtaṃ sammappaññāya passato yā

____

-- Yes, bhante.

____

who perceives according to reality with perfect penetrative discernment: 'With
the ending of that nourishing condition, what is brought about is destined to
cease'?

_Tadāhāranirodhā yaṃ bhūtaṃ taṃ nirodhadhamman ti bhikkhave
yathābhūtaṃ sammappaññāya passato yā vicikicchā sā pahīyatī ti_
____

-- Yes, bhante (M.1.260).

===== Doubt about the significance of the teaching, the unexplained issues, and dogmatism

____
-- Bhante, what is the cause and reason that doubt [about the significance of
the teaching] does not arise in the learned noble disciple on account of the
unexplained issues?

_Ko nu kho bhante hetu ko paccayo yena sutavato ariyasāvakassa vicikicchā
nūppajjati avyākatavatthusu_

-- To the learned noble disciple, through the ending of dogmatism, doubt [about
the significance of the teaching] does not arise on account of the unexplained
issues

_diṭṭhinirodhā kho bhikkhu sutavato ariyasāvakassa vicikicchā
nūppajjati avyākatavatthusu._

Asserting that the Perfect One exists after death: this is acquiescence in
dogmatism.

_Hoti tathāgato parammaraṇā ti kho bhikkhu diṭṭhigatametaṃ_

Asserting that the Perfect One does not exist after death: this is acquiescence
in dogmatism,

_na hoti tathāgato parammaraṇā ti kho bhikkhu diṭṭhigatametaṃ_

Asserting that the Perfect One both exists and does not exist after death: this
is acquiescence in dogmatism,

_hoti ca na hoti ca tathāgato parammaraṇā ti kho bhikkhu
diṭṭhigatametaṃ_

Asserting that the Perfect One neither exists nor does not exist after death:
this is acquiescence in dogmatism.

===== Doubt regarding the periods of the past, future, and present

The scriptures speak of 'doubt about the periods of the past, future, and
present,' which makes better sense if taken as 'doubt about the [nature of
reality in the] periods of the past, future, and present,' thus:

[quote, D.3.217]
____
Three states of unsureness: one is unsure, doubtful, undecided, unsettled,
about the [nature of reality in the] periods of the past, the future, and the
present

_Tisso kaṅkhā. Atītaṃ vā addhānaṃ... anāgataṃ vā addhānaṃ...
etarahi vā paccuppannaṃ addhānaṃ ārabbha kaṅkhati vicikicchati
nādhimuccati na sampasīdati._
____

This interpretation is illustrated in the following conversation:

____
If, headman, I were to teach you about the origination and vanishing of
suffering with reference to the past, saying, 'So it was in the past,'
unsureness about the [nature of reality in the] past might arise in you.

_Ahañce te gāmaṇi atītaṃ addhānaṃ ārabbha dukkhassa samudayañca
atthaṅgamañca deseyyaṃ: evaṃ ahosi atītamaddhānan ti tatra te siyā
kaṅkhā siyā vimati._

(...) And if I were to teach you about the origination and vanishing of suffering
with reference to the future, saying, 'So it will be in the future,' unsureness
about the [nature of reality in the] future might arise in you.

_Ahañce te gāmaṇi anāgatamaddhānaṃ ārabbha dukkhassa samudayañca
atthaṅgamañca deseyyaṃ. Evaṃ bhavissati anāgatamaddhānan ti tatrāpi
te siyā kaṅkhā siyā vimati._

(...) Instead, headman, while I am sitting right here, and you are sitting right
there, I will teach you about the origination and vanishing of suffering.
Listen, pay careful attention, and I will speak.

_Api cāhaṃ gāmaṇi idheva nisinno ettha ca te nisinnassa dukkhassa
samudayañca atthaṅgamañca desissāmi. Taṃ suṇāhi sādhukaṃ
manasikarohi bhāsissāmī ti_
____

Having shown the headman that suffering in the present stems from fondness and
attachment in the present, the Buddha then extends the discussion to the past
and future:

[quote, S.4.327]
____
Through this profound truth that is seen, understood, realised in the here and
now, penetrated, you can deduce about the past and the future thus:

_Iminā tvaṃ gāmaṇi dhammena diṭṭhena viditena akālikena pattena
pariyogāḷhena atītānāgate nayaṃ nehi_

(...) Whatever suffering arose in the past, all of it stemmed from fondness, with
fondness as its basis; for fondness is the origin of suffering.

_yaṃ kho kiñci atītamaddhānaṃ dukkhaṃ uppajjamānaṃ uppajjati
sabbantaṃ chandamūlakaṃ chandanidānaṃ chando hi mūlaṃ dukkhassa_

(...) Whatever suffering will arise in the future, all of it will stem from
fondness, with fondness as its basis; for fondness is the origin of suffering.

_yaṃ hi kiñci anāgatamaddhānaṃ dukkhaṃ uppajjamānaṃ uppajjissati
sabbantaṃ chandamūlakaṃ chandanidānaṃ chando hi mūlaṃ dukkhassā ti._

===== Doubt [about the perfection of the Blessed One's body]

Brahmans who searched the Buddha's body for the thirty-two marks of a Great
Man, which, for them, were signs of perfect enlightenment, of a Great Man, were
always 'doubtful' about the two marks which were not immediately obvious. To
make any sense, this unspecified doubt is best understood as 'doubt [about the
perfection of the Blessed One's body],' as these three examples show:

[quote, M.2.143]
____
All thirty two of the marks that you have heard are the marks of a Great Man
are to be found on my body. So, brahman, do not be unsure [about the perfection
of the Blessed One's body].

_Ye te dvattiṃsāti sutā mahāpurisalakkhaṇā +
Sabbe te mama kāyasmiṃ. Mā te kaṅkhāhu brāhmaṇa._
____

[quote, D.1.105-6]
____
Then Ambaṭṭha, the young brahman, while pacing back and forth with the
Blessed One, looked for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Blessed
One's body, and could see all but two of them.

_Atha kho ambaṭṭho māṇavo bhagavantaṃ caṅkamantaṃ
anucaṅkamamāno kāye dvattiṃsamahāpurisalakkhaṇāni samannesi. Addasa
kho ambaṭṭho māṇavo bhagavato kāye dvattiṃsamahāpurisalakkhaṇāni
yebhuyyena ṭhapetvā dve_

(...) He was unsure, doubtful, undecided, unsettled [about the perfection of
the Blessed One's body] in respect of two of these marks: the sheathed genitals
and the large tongue.

_Dvīsu mahāpurisalakkhaṇesu kaṅkhati vicikicchati nādhimuccati na
sampasīdati kosohite ca vatthaguyhe pahūtajivhatāya ca_

(...) And so, being aware of this, the Blessed One arranged by psychic power that
Ambaṭṭha could see his sheathed genitals, and then, sticking out his
tongue, he licked both ears and both nostrils backwards and forwards, and
covered the whole width of his forehead with his tongue.

_Atha kho bhagavā tathārūpaṃ iddhābhisaṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkāsi yathā
addasa ambaṭṭho māṇavo bhagavato kosohitaṃ vatthaguyhaṃ. Atha kho
bhagavā jivhaṃ ninnāmetvā ubho pi kaṇṇasotāni anumasi parimasi. Ubho
pi nāsikāsotāni anumasi parimasi. Kevalampi naḷāṭamaṇḍalaṃ
jivhāya chādesi._

(...) Then Ambaṭṭha thought: 'The ascetic Gotama is possessed of all
thirty-two marks of a Great Man, with all present and none missing.

_Atha kho ambaṭṭhassa māṇavassa etadahosi samannāgato kho samaṇo
gotamo dvattiṃsamahāpurisalakkhaṇehi paripuṇṇehi no aparipuṇṇehī ti._

===== Ajita's quest: doubt [about the perfection of the Perfect One's transcendent insight]

The brahman Ajita was sent by his teacher to examine the Buddha as to whether
he was perfectly enlightened or not, and to put him through a series of tests:

- 'If he is the Enlightened One, one of unobstructed vision, he will answer in
speech the questions you ask in your mind.' (Sn.v.1005).

In this quest, Ajita used the word _kaṅkhā_ and _kaṅkhati_ which should be
parenthesised as follows:

[quote, Sn.v.1021]
____
Give a detailed account of Bāvari's marks, best of men, the destroyer of
unsureness. Let there be no unsureness in us [about the perfection of the
Perfect One's transcendent insight].

_Lakkhaṇānaṃ pavicayaṃ, bāvarissa naruttama; +
Kaṅkhacchida pakāsehi, mā no kaṅkhāyitaṃ ahu._
____

===== Sakka's Questions: doubt about the way of spiritual fulfilment, and of unfulfilment

The Buddha removed the arrow of doubt and uncertainty long lurking in Sakka,
Lord of the Devas, through answering his four main questions plus six
subsidiary questions (D.2.283). But doubt and uncertainty about what? The
answer is found at the end of the conversation in the _Sakkapañha Sutta_, when
Sakka explained the history of his inquiry:

[quote, D.2.287]
____
Thinking that ascetics living secludedly were enlightened, and that I should go
and follow them, I had asked them, 'What is the way of spiritual fulfilment?
What is the way of spiritual unfulfilment?' But when asked, they were unable to
explain the relevant path and practices.

_Yassu maññāmi samaṇe pavivittavihārino; +
Sambuddhā iti maññāno gacchāmi te upāsituṃ. +
Kathaṃ ārādhanā hoti kathaṃ hoti virādhanā; +
Iti puṭṭhā na sampāyanti magge paṭipadāsu ca._
____

This shows that the doubt and uncertainty long lurking in Sakka concerned the
way of spiritual fulfilment (_ārādhanā_), and of unfulfilment
(_virādhanā_). This qualification can therefore be parenthesised in
translation. For example, after the Buddha answered each question, Sakka
exclaimed:

____
'So it is, Blessed One, so it is, Sublime One. Having heard the Blessed One's
answer to my question, unsureness [about the way of spiritual fulfilment, and
of unfulfilment] is overcome in me; uncertainty [about the way of spiritual
fulfilment, and of unfulfilment] has disappeared!'

_Evametaṃ bhagavā evametaṃ sugata tiṇṇā me'ttha kaṅkhā vigatā
kathaṅkathā bhagavato pañhaveyyākaraṇaṃ sutvā ti._
____

Likewise, Sakka's exclamation at the end of the conversation can be rendered:

[quote, D.2.287]
____
Long I wandered, objective unfulfilled, doubtful and uncertain [about the way
of spiritual fulfilment, and of unfulfilment], in quest of the Perfect One.

_Apariyositasaṅkappo vicikiccho kathaṅkathī. +
Vicariṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ anvesanto tathāgataṃ._
____

Sakka's four main questions are all consistent with an inquiry about the way of
spiritual fulfilment, and of unfulfilment. They are as follows:

1. Because of what bond is it, that devas, humans, asuras, magical serpents,
heavenly musicians and whatever other kinds there may be, although they wish to
abide free of unfriendliness, violence, enmity, hostility, and uncordiality,
why do they in fact abide with all these things?

===== Māra's seventh army: doubt [about the significance of abandoning spiritually unwholesome factors and undertaking spiritually wholesome factors]

Before his enlightenment, the Buddha was tempted by Māra to abandon his
struggle. It was here that the Buddha said that Māra's seventh army is doubt
(_Sattamī vicikicchā te_, Sn.v.437). Usually we would call _vicikicchā_
'doubt [about the significance of the teaching].' See IGPT sv _Vicikicchā_.
But here, as yet, there is no Buddha or teaching. We therefore take the object
of _vicikicchā_ to be _kusalesu dhammesu_ from this quote:

[quote, "M.3.136, D.1.204"]
____
Abandoning doubt [about the significance of the teaching], he abides having
overcome doubt [about the significance of the teaching], with no uncertainty
about [the significance of abandoning spiritually unwholesome factors and
undertaking] spiritually wholesome factors.

_Vicikicchaṃ pahāya tiṇṇavicikiccho viharati akathaṅkathī kusalesu
dhammesu._
____

Accordingly, Māra's seventh army is 'doubt [about the significance of
abandoning spiritually unwholesome factors and undertaking spiritually
wholesome factors]'. This also accords with the nature of the Buddha's search
at that time:

[quote, M.1.163]
____
Having gone forth [into the ascetic life] in search of what is spiritually
wholesome, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace, I approached Āḷāra
Kālāma.'

_So evaṃ pabbajito samāno kiṃkusalagavesī anuttaraṃ santivarapadaṃ
pariyesamāno yena āḷāro kālāmo tenupasaṅkamiṃ._
____

===== Uncertainty about [the significance of abandoning spiritually unwholesome factors and undertaking] spiritually wholesome factors

We used this quote in the section above:

[quote, "M.3.136, D.1.204"]
____
Abandoning doubt [about the significance of the teaching], he abides having
overcome doubt [about the significance of the teaching], with no uncertainty
about [the significance of abandoning spiritually unwholesome factors and
undertaking] spiritually wholesome factors. He cleanses his mind of doubt
[about the significance of the teaching].

_Vicikicchaṃ pahāya tiṇṇavicikiccho viharati akathaṅkathī kusalesu
dhammesu. Vicikicchāya cittaṃ parisodheti._
____

We make two points:

1. Applying the same parentheses, i.e. '[significance of],' would only be
justified if 'the teaching' concerns 'the abandoning of spiritually unwholesome
factors and undertaking of spiritually wholesome factors.' Which it does, says
this quote:
+
[quote, Dh.v.183]
____
The refraining from everything unvirtuous; the undertaking of what is
spiritually wholesome; the purification of one's mind: this is the training
system of the Buddhas.

_Sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṃ kusalassa upasampadā +
Sacittapariyodapanaṃ etaṃ buddhānaṃ sāsanaṃ._
____

2. According to our parenthesis, spiritually unwholesome factors are
'abandoned' and spiritually wholesome factors are 'undertaken'. The parentheses
come from these two quotes:
+
[quote, S.3.8]
____
The Blessed One praises the abandonment of spiritually unwholesome factors.

_bhagavā akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ pahānaṃ vaṇṇeti._
____
+
[quote, S.3.9]
____
The Blessed One praises the undertaking of spiritually wholesome factors.

_bhagavā kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ upasampadaṃ vaṇṇetī ti._

COMMENT

_Kaṅkhī vecikicchī_: 'Unsure and doubtful [about the perfection of the
Perfect One's transcendent insight].' The object of Sabhiya's unsureness and
doubt is unspecified, but there are two reasons we can say that his doubt is
not 'doubt about the questions' (an expression which anyway is meaningless),
but about the perfection of the Perfect One's transcendent insight.

1. The original purpose of the questions was not to discover their answers, but
to find out under whom he should live the religious life.

2. It is indicated by the second sentence in this quote, beginning with
'Certainly' (_addhā_):

- _viññāṇa_: mind

- _viññāṇa_: mental consciousness

- _viññāṇa_: thought

- _viññāṇa_: insight

- _viññāṇa_: 'personal _viññāṇa_' (Bhikkhu Sāti)

==== Introduction

===== Viññāṇa: the mental component of sensation

As a component of _phassa_, _viññāṇa_ is the mental component of
sensation. It arises dependent on the association of the internal and external
sense bases. For example:

[quote, M.1.111]
____
Dependent on the visual sense and visible objects, advertence to the visual
field arises

_cakkhuñcāvuso paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṃ._
____

We call it 'advertence.' We regard it as equivalent to attention, but without
its false connotations. 'Advertence' is clearly conditional, whereas
'attention' seems to imply an independent entity which hovers over objects, and
which is under the control of intention. Attention is represented by the term
_manasikāra_. For example:

[quote, S.5.184]
____
With the origination of attention comes the origination of objects of the
systematic teachings. With the ending of attention comes the vanishing of
objects of the systematic teachings.

_Manasikārasamudayā dhammānaṃ samudayo. Manasikāranirodhā dhammānaṃ
atthaṅgamo ti._
____

There are six varieties of advertence corresponding to the six senses. We call
these: advertence to the visual field, advertence to the auditory field,
advertence to the olfactory field, advertence to the gustatory field,
advertence to the tactile field, and advertence to the mental field
(_cakkhuviññāṇaṃ sotaviññāṇaṃ ghānaviññāṇaṃ
jivhāviññāṇaṃ kāyaviññāṇaṃ manoviññāṇaṃ_, M.3.281).

===== Viññāṇakkhandha: advertence

The phenomenon of _viññāṇakkhandha_ is also 'advertence,' and is defined
as that by which one discerns objects and sense impression, for instance
different flavours (Quote 1, S.3.87) or pleasure and pain (Quote 2, M.1.292-3):

Quote 1)

[quote, S.3.87]
____
And why do you call it advertence? One knows therefore it is called advertence.
And what does one know? One knows sour, one knows bitter, one knows pungent,
one knows sweet, one knows sharp, one knows mild, one knows salty, one knows
bland. 'One knows,' bhikkhus, therefore it is called advertence.

_Vijānātī ti kho bhikkhave tasmā viññāṇan ti vuccati. Kiñca
vijānāti: ambilampi vijānāti tittakampi vijānāti kaṭukampi vijānāti
madhurakampi vijānāti khārikampi vijānāti akhārikampi vijānāti
loṇikampi vijānāti aloṇikampi vijānāti. Vijānātī ti kho bhikkhave
tasmā viññāṇan ti vuccati._
____

Quote 2)

[quote, M.1.292-3]
____
One knows, one knows. Therefore advertence is said. What does one know? One
knows what is pleasant, one knows what is unpleasant, one knows what is neutral.

_Vijānāti vijānātī ti kho āvuso tasmā viññāṇan ti vuccati. Kiñca
vijānāti sukhan ti pi vijānāti dukkhan ti pi vijānāti adukkhamasukhan ti
pi vijānāti._
____

===== Viññāṇa: the instrument of knowledge, not a knowing phenomenon

The instrumental case in the following quote (_tena ca viññāṇena_) shows
that _viññāṇa_ is the instrument through which one knows sensation.

[quote, M.3.242]
____
What does one know with that _viññāṇa_? One knows what is pleasant, one
knows what is unpleasant, one knows what is neutral.

_Tena ca viññāṇena kiṃ vijānāti: sukhan ti pi vijānāti dukkhan ti pi
vijānāti adukkhamasukhan ti pi vijānāti._
____

This suggests that _viññāṇa_ is a knowing phenomenon, which is how Bodhi
understands it. He says 'Usually in the suttas _viññāṇa_ is presented
simply as the basic awareness of an object via one of the sense bases, i.e. as
bare "consciousness of" rather than as a discriminative capacity' (CDB p.1072
n.114). But this presupposes that awareness of an object produces sensation,
whereas awareness of an object is surely equivalent to sensation, and it would
lead to the following translation:

[quote, M.3.281]
____
Dependent on the visual sense and visible objects, basic awareness of an object
arises. The association of the three is sensation.

_Cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṃ. Tiṇṇaṃ
saṅgati phasso._
____

But the suttas say that for sensation there needs to be all three elements:

[quote, D.1.43]
____
That they should experience anything without sensation could not be

_te vata aññatra phassā paṭisaṃvedissantīti netaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati._
____

===== Viññāṇakkhandha = viññāṇa of phassa: Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta

The _viññāṇa_ of the fifth aggregate is the _viññāṇa_ of _phassa_.
This can be demonstrated in three ways:

1. The _Mahāhatthipadopama Sutta_ says:
+
[quote, M.1.190]
____
If the visual sense is operational and visible objects come into its range, and
there is an operative interaction between them, then the appropriate class of
_viññāṇa_ is manifested... The _viññāṇa_ in whatever is thus brought
about comprises _viññāṇūpādānakkhandha.'_

_ajjhattikañce cakkhuṃ aparibhinnaṃ hoti bāhirā ca rūpā āpāthaṃ
āgacchanti tajjo ca samannāhāro hoti evaṃ tajjassa viññāṇabhāgassa
pātubhāvo hoti... yaṃ tathābhūtassa viññāṇaṃ taṃ
viññāṇūpādānakkhandhe saṅgahaṃ gacchati._
____

2. If the fifth aggregate was different from the _viññāṇa_ of _phassa_,
then the _viññāṇa_ of _phassa_ would have no aggregate to belong to. It is
not material, so it could not belong to the first aggregate of bodily form. Nor
could it belong to the three immaterial aggregates, because they depend on
_phassa_:
+
[quote, M.3.17]
____
Sensation is the indispensible and necessary condition by which the aggregates
of sense impression, perception, and intentional activities are to be
discerned._

_phasso hetu phasso paccayo vedanakkhandhassa... saññākkhandhassa...
saṅkhārakkhandhassa paññāpanāya._
____

3. _Viññāṇakkhandha_ and _phasso_ have the same source, i.e.
_nāmarūpaṃ_:
+
[quote, S.3.102]
____
Denomination-and-bodily-form is the indispensible and necessary condition
by which the aggregate of advertence is to be discerned.

nāmarūpaṃ hetu nāmarūpaṃ paccayo viññāṇakkhandhassa
paññāpanāyā ti_.
____
+
[quote, Sn.v.872]
____
Sensation arises dependent on denomination-and-bodily-form.

_Nāmañca rūpañca paṭicca phasso._
____

===== Viññāṇakkhandha = viññāṇa of phassa: puzzling relationship to nāmarūpa

If the _viññāṇa_ of the fifth aggregate is identical with the
_viññāṇa_ of _phassa_, then it must also arise from the six senses and
their objects. But the quotes above say it arises from _nāmarūpa_. To explain
this, we will now show that '_nāmarūpa_' can mean the six senses and their
objects because of the expression 'external _nāmarūpa'_ which we now discuss.

===== External nāmarūpa + internal nāmarūpa = senses + objects

Our explanation is based on the following quote:

[quote, S.2.24]
____
There is this [wretched human] body and the external _nāmarūpa_. Thus is this
dyad. Because of the dyad there is sensation.

_Iti ayañceva kāyo bahiddhā ca nāmarūpaṃ. Itthetaṃ dvayaṃ. Dvayaṃ
paṭicca phasso._
____

In this quote, 'this [wretched human] body' seems to stand for 'internal
_nāmarūpa_.' The quote corresponds to the more common explanation:

[quote, M.3.281]
____
Dependent on the visual sense and visible objects, advertence to the visual
field arises. The association of the three is sensation.

_Cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṃ. Tiṇṇaṃ
saṅgati phasso._
____

'The visual sense' is the first of the six senses (_ajjhattikāni āyatanāni_,
D.3.243), and 'visible objects' is the first of the six sense objects
(_bāhirāni āyatanāni_, D.3.243).

By comparison of quotes, internal _nāmarūpa_ corresponds to the six senses,
and external _nāmarūpa_ corresponds to the six sense objects. So when the
scriptures say that '_nāmarūpa_ is the indispensible and necessary condition
by which the aggregate of advertence is to be discerned' it is likely that
_nāmarūpa_ corresponds to the six senses and their objects.

===== Viññāṇa of paṭiccasamuppāda: stream of sense consciousness

In the context of _paṭiccasamuppāda_, we call _viññāṇa_ the 'stream of
sense consciousness.' Bodhi calls this 'the underlying stream of consciousness
which sustains personal continuity through a single life and threads together
successive lives' (CDB p.769 n.154). This _viññāṇa_ arises in the mother's
womb and supports the development of _nāmarūpa_:

[quote, D.2.63]
____
If a stream of sense consciousness did not arise in the womb, would
denomination-and-bodily-form develop there? No, bhante.

_viññāṇañca hi ānanda mātukucchismiṃ na okkamissatha api nu kho
nāmarūpaṃ mātukucchismiṃ samuccissathā ti? No hetaṃ bhante._
____

[quote, D.2.63]
____
If the stream of sense consciousness of a young boy or girl were eradicated,
would denomination-and-bodily-form grow, mature, and develop? No, bhante.

_viññāṇañca hi ānanda daharasseva sato vocchijjissatha kumārakassa vā
kumārikāya vā api nu kho nāmarūpaṃ vuddhiṃ virūḷhiṃ vepullaṃ
āpajjissathā ti? No hetaṃ bhante._
____

At death, this same _viññāṇa_ finds a new place to establish itself
(_viññāṇaṃ patiṭṭhitan ti_, S.1.122), and can be named after the
individual it used to be, for example:

[quote, S.1.122]
____
The stream of sense consciousness of the noble young man Godhika

_godhikassa kulaputtassa viññāṇaṃ._
____

In arahants, because there is no rebirth, their _viññāṇa_ is not
established anywhere (_appatiṭṭhitena viññāṇena parinibbuto ti_).
Other suttas say the _viññāṇa_ is demolished (_viññāṇaṃ
uparujjhatī ti_ Sn.v.1111). The mysterious relationship between these two
apparently equal events -- 'not established _viññāṇa_' and 'demolished
_viññāṇa_' -- is presumably no more to be resolved than the question as to
whether an arahant continues to exist after death, or not.

===== The stream of sense consciousness depends on perception

Although there are nine realms of beings (_nava sattāvāsā_ A.4.401), there
are only seven stations for _viññāṇa_ (_satta viññāṇaṭṭhitiyo_
D.2.69), which implies that in two realms there is no _viññāṇa._ These two
realms are:

[quote, D.2.69]
____
the group of beings without perception

_asaññasattāyatanaṃ_

the group of beings neither having nor lacking perception

_nevasaññānāsaññāyatanameva._
____

Thus in the context of the nine realms of beings, _viññāṇa_ depends on
perception. Without perception a being has no _viññāṇa._ This is
consistent with our calling this _viññāṇa_ the 'stream of sense
consciousness.'

===== Stream of sense consciousness: six streams

This _viññāṇa_ is comprised of six streams (M.1.53; S.2.44). These streams
are named in Pāli in the same way as the _viññāṇa_ of _phasso_. We call
these:

____
the stream of visual consciousness

_cakkhuviññāṇaṃ_

the stream of auditory consciousness

_sotaviññāṇaṃ_

the stream of olfactory consciousness

_ghānaviññāṇaṃ_

the stream of gustatory consciousness

_jivhāviññāṇaṃ_

the stream of tactile consciousness

_kāyaviññāṇaṃ_

the stream of mental consciousness

_manoviññāṇaṃ_
____

The stream of sense consciousness plays an important role in rebirth.

===== The stream of sense consciousness and rebirth

The stream of sense consciousness plays a key role in rebirth:

[quote, A.1.223-4]
____
For beings [obstructed by] uninsightfulness into reality, and [tethered to

===== The stream of sense consciousness and kamma

The effect of _kamma_ on the stream of sense consciousness is explained in this
quote:

[quote, S.2.82]
____
Bhikkhus, if one who has acquiesced in uninsightfulness into reality undertakes
a karmically consequential deed that is meritorious, his stream of sense
consciousness is furnished with merit;

_Avijjāgatoyaṃ bhikkhave purisapuggalo puññaṃ ce saṅkhāraṃ
abhisaṅkharoti puññopagaṃ hoti viññāṇaṃ._

If he undertakes a karmically consequential deed that is demeritorious, his
stream of sense consciousness is furnished with demerit;

_Apuññaṃ ce saṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharoti apuññopagaṃ hoti
viññāṇaṃ._

If he undertakes a karmically consequential deed that is karmically neutral,
his stream of sense consciousness is furnished with what is karmically neutral.

_Āneñjaṃ ce saṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharoti āneñjūpagaṃ hoti
viññāṇaṃ._

(...) When a bhikkhu has abandoned uninsightfulness into reality and aroused
insightfulness into reality, then, with the fading away of uninsightfulness
into reality and the arising of insightfulness into reality, he does not
undertake a karmically consequential deed that is meritorious, demeritorious,
or karmically neutral.

_Yato kho bhikkhave bhikkhuno avijjā pahīṇā hoti vijjā uppannā so
avijjāvirāgā vijjūppādā neva puññābhisaṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharoti
na apuññābhisaṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharoti na āneñjābhisaṅkhāraṃ
abhisaṅkharoti._
____

===== The stream of sense consciousness is liberated [from perceptually obscuring states]

Some suttas say that at arahantship, the stream of sense consciousness is
liberated [from perceptually obscuring states], like this:

[quote, S.3.53]
____
Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu has abandoned attachment to bodily form, with the
abandonment of attachment the basis is removed: there is no establishment of
his stream of sense consciousness.

_Rūpadhātuyā ce bhikkhave bhikkhuno rāgo pahīno hoti rāgassa pahānā
vocchijjatārammaṇaṃ patiṭṭhā viññāṇassa na hoti_

(...) When the stream of sense consciousness is unestablished, not [egoistically]
matured, without the performance of [karmically consequential deeds], it is
liberated [from perceptually obscuring states].

_tadappatiṭṭhitaṃ viññāṇaṃ avirūḷhaṃ anabhisaṅkhacca
vimuttaṃ._
____

[quote, S.3.54]
____
Being thus liberated it is inwardly stable

_Vimuttattā ṭhitaṃ_

Being inwardly stable it is inwardly at peace

_Ṭhitattā santusitaṃ_

Being inwardly at peace, he is not apprehensive

_Santusitattā na paritassati._

Being not apprehensive, he realises the Untroubled for himself.

_Aparitassaṃ paccattaṃ yeva parinibbāyati._
____

_Vimuttaṃ_, _ṭhitaṃ, and santusitaṃ_ are neuter singulars in agreement
with _viññāṇaṃ._ But _paritassati_ seems to refer to the individual who
is individually liberated.

In other suttas, the same process is described, but where the liberated entity
is the _citta_, or the bhikkhu:

[quote, S.3.45]
____
If a bhikkhu's mind is unattached to bodily form... advertence, it is liberated
from perceptually obscuring states through being without grasping.

_Rūpadhātuyā... viññāṇadhātuyā ce bhikkhave bhikkhuno cittaṃ
virattaṃ vimuttaṃ hoti anupādāya āsavehi._
____

[quote, M.1.235]
____
When a bhikkhu sees it thus according to reality with perfect penetrative
discernment, he is liberated [from perceptually obscuring states] through being
without grasping.

_bhikkhu... evametaṃ yathābhūtaṃ sammappaññāya disvā anupādā
vimutto hoti._
____

In the latter case, _vimutto_ is masculine singular in agreement with _bhikkhu_.

===== The stream of sense consciousness ceases with arahantship

Arahants have no stream of sense consciousness because they are free of
karmically consequential deeds:

-- What do you think, bhikkhus: can a bhikkhu whose _āsavas_ are destroyed,
undertake a karmically consequential deed that is meritorious, demeritorious,
or karmically neutral?

-- No, bhante.

____
When there are utterly no karmically consequential deeds, with the ending of
karmically consequential deeds, would the stream of sense consciousness be
discerned?

_Sabbaso vā pana saṅkhāresu asati saṅkhāranirodhā api nu kho
viññāṇaṃ paññāyethā ti?_
____

-- No, bhante.

____
-- When there is utterly no stream of sense consciousness, with the ending of
the stream of sense consciousness, would denomination-and-bodily-form be
discerned?

_Sabbaso vā pana viññāṇe asati viññāṇanirodhā api nu kho
nāmarūpaṃ paññāyethā ti?_
____

-- No, bhante (S.2.83).

===== Viññāṇasota: stream of sense consciousness

The suttas say that _viññāṇasotaṃ_ is a stream that is established in
this world and the world beyond, which is indistinguishable from the stream of
sense consciousness. _Viññāṇa_ is apparently an abbreviation for
_viññāṇasotaṃ_.

[quote, D.3.105]
____
He comes to know man's stream of sense consciousness as an unbroken stream that
is established in both this world and the world beyond. That is the third
attainment of vision [of things according to reality].

_purisassa ca viññāṇasotaṃ pajānāti ubhayato abbocchinnaṃ idha loke
patiṭṭhitañca paraloke patiṭṭhitaṃ ca. Ayaṃ tatiyā
dassanasamāpatti._
____

[quote, D.3.105]
____
He comes to know man's stream of sense consciousness as an unbroken stream that
is established neither in this world nor in the world beyond. That is the
fourth attainment of vision [of things according to reality].

_purisassa ca viññāṇasotaṃ pajānāti ubhayato abbocchinnaṃ idha loke
appatiṭṭhitañca paraloke appatiṭṭhitañca. Ayaṃ catutthā
dassanasamāpatti._
____

This is therefore an 'unestablished stream,' which we now discuss.

===== Stream of sense consciousness that is not established in arahants

The last paragraph presumably refers to arahants because the arahants
_viññāṇa_ is not established anywhere. For example, when the arahant
Godhika died, the Buddha said that with the stream of sense consciousness
unestablished, the noble young man Godhika had passed away to the
Untroubled-without-residue' (_appatiṭṭhitena ca bhikkhave viññāṇena
godhiko kulaputto parinibbutoti_) (S.1.122).

It is easily understandable how the _viññāṇa_ of a living arahant could be
called 'unestablished,' because the arahant still has a stream of sense
impression but no sense of a personal identity. But after his death, the issue
of an unestablished _viññāṇa_ is inexplicable, because other suttas
say the arahant's _viññāṇa_ is demolished (_viññāṇaṃ uparujjhatī
ti_ Sn.v.1111). We have noted this problem above. It is one of the unexplained
issues (_avyākatavatthū_, A.4.68-70).

===== Refining of mental consciousness means detaching the mind

_Viññāṇa_ is sometimes used to mean 'mental consciousness'. This mental
consciousness (_viññāṇaṃ_) becomes purified and refined when one
detaches the mind (_cittaṃ_) from the material phenomena through seeing them
as being void of personal qualities:

____
The internal Solidness Phenomenon and the external Solidness Phenomenon are
simply the Solidness Phenomenon, which should be seen according to reality with
perfect penetrative discernment as "not [in reality] mine," "not [in reality]
what I am," "not my [absolute] Selfhood."'

_Yā ceva kho pana ajjhattikā paṭhavīdhātu yā ca bāhirā
paṭhavīdhātu paṭhavīdhāturevesā taṃ n'etaṃ mama n'eso'hamasmi na
me so attā ti evametaṃ yathābhūtaṃ sammappaññāya daṭṭhabbaṃ._

(...) When one sees it thus according to reality with perfect penetrative
discernment, one is disillusioned with the Solidness Phenomenon and one
detaches the mind from the Solidness Phenomenon

_Evametaṃ yathābhūtaṃ sammappaññāya disvā paṭhavīdhātuyā
nibbindati paṭhavīdhātuyā cittaṃ virājeti_
____

(...) and similarly for the Liquidness Phenomenon, Warmth Phenomenon, Gaseousness
Phenomenon, Space Element.

[quote, M.3.242]
____
(...) Then there remains only mental consciousness, purified and refined

_Athāparaṃ viññāṇaṃ yeva avasissati parisuddhaṃ pariyodātaṃ_

What does one know with that mental consciousness? One knows what is pleasant,
one knows what is unpleasant, one knows what is neutral.

_Tena ca viññāṇena kiṃ vijānāti: sukhan ti pi vijānāti dukkhan ti pi
vijānāti adukkhamasukhan ti pi vijānāti._
____

===== Boundless mental consciousness

_Viññāṇa_ can be used as a kasiṇa object (_viññāṇakasiṇa_) and
stands in contrast to the kasiṇas of earth, water, fire, wind, blue, yellow,
red, white, space. Therefore we again call it mental consciousness. Thus one
perceives the kasiṇa of mental consciousness extending above, below, and
across from oneself, with no subject/object duality and without limitation
(_viññāṇakasiṇameko sañjānāti uddhaṃ adho tiriyaṃ advayaṃ
appamāṇaṃ_ A.5.60).

===== Boundless mental consciousness: sphere of meditation

[quote, M.2.13]
____
Boundless mental consciousness is a sphere of meditation, perhaps similar to
the _viññāṇakasiṇa_. To enter the state of awareness of boundless mental
consciousness a bhikkhu must completely transcend the state of awareness of
boundless space, and enter and abide in the state of awareness of boundless
mental consciousness, where one perceives that mental consciousness is boundless

_sabbaso ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ samatikkamma anantaṃ viññāṇan ti
viññāṇañcākāsānañcāyatanaṃ samatikkamma anantaṃ viññāṇan ti
viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati._
____

===== Boundless mental consciousness: station for the stream of sense consciousness

The state of awareness of boundless mental consciousness is the sixth station
for the stream of sense consciousness.

[quote, D.2.69]
____
There are beings, Ānanda, that, by completely transcending the state of
awareness of boundless space, arise in the state of awareness of boundless
mental consciousness, where one perceives that mental consciousness is
boundless. This is the sixth station for the stream of sense consciousness.

_Santānanda sattā sabbaso ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ samatikkamma anantaṃ
viññāṇan ti viññāṇañcāyatanūpagā. Ayaṃ chaṭṭhā
viññāṇaṭṭhiti._
____

===== Viññāṇa: Mind

_Viññāṇa_ is used to mean mind:

[quote, M.3.227]
____
The ignorant Everyman considers bodily form to be the [absolute] Selfhood, or
the [absolute] Selfhood to be corporeal. If that bodily form changes and
alters, his mind is preoccupied with the change.

_Tassa taṃ rūpaṃ vipariṇamati aññathā hoti. Tassa
rūpavipariṇāmaññathābhāvā rūpavipariṇāmānuparivatti
viññāṇaṃ hoti._
____

- If a bhikkhu sees a visible object via the visual sense, and his mind pursues
the phantasm of the visible object (_rūpanimittānusāri viññāṇaṃ
hoti_)... then his mind is called 'distracted and scattered externally
(_bahiddhā viññāṇaṃ vikkhittaṃ visaṭanti vuccati_ (M.3.225).

[quote, S.4.102]
____
There are, Lord of the Devas, visible objects known via the visual sense that
are likeable, loveable, pleasing, agreeable, connected with sensuous pleasure,
and charming. If a bhikkhu takes delight in them, welcomes them, and persists
in cleaving to them, then the mind is attached to them (_tannissitaṃ
viññāṇaṃ hoti_). That is grasping.

_Santi kho devānaminda cakkhuviññeyyā rūpā iṭṭhā kantā manāpā
piyarūpā kāmūpasaṃhitā rajanīyā tañce bhikkhu abhinandati abhivadati
ajjhosāya tiṭṭhati tassa taṃ abhinandato abhivadato ajjhosāya
tiṭṭhato tannissitaṃ viññāṇaṃ hoti tadupādānaṃ._
____

===== Viññāṇa: Thoughts

_Viññāṇa_ is used in the plural to mean 'thoughts' (_viññāṇānaṃ_):

[quote, Th.v.419]
____
(The eightfold path) causes the thunderbolt of knowledge [of things according
to reality] to fall on thoughts which have been taken hold of.

_Viññāṇānaṃ pariggahe ñāṇavajīranipātino._
____

===== Viññāṇa: Insight

_Viññāṇa_ can mean insight:

[quote, Th.v.1035]
____
Wanting insight into the teaching, one should associate with a disciple of the
Buddha who has great learning, who is an expert in the teaching, and who is
wise.

_Bahussutaṃ dhammadharaṃ sappaññaṃ buddhasāvakaṃ
dhammaviññāṇamākaṅkhaṃ taṃ bhajetha tathāvidhaṃ._
____

- I thought, 'By this practice of austerities, I have not attained any
superhuman attainment of knowledge and vision worthy of the Noble Ones. Could
there be another path to enlightenment? (_siyā nu kho añño maggo bodhāyā
ti_).

[quote, M.1.246]
____
... Then something occurred to me. Once, while my Sakyan father was
working, while I was sitting in the cool shade of a roseapple tree, secluded
from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors, and having entered
and abided in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thinking and pondering,
and rapture and physical pleasure born of seclusion [from sensuous pleasures
and spiritually unwholesome factors], I recalled asking myself 'Could this be
the way to enlightenment' (_siyā nu kho eso maggo bodhāyā ti_).

_Tassa mayhaṃ aggivessana etadahosi abhijānāmi kho paṇāhaṃ
pitusakkassa kammante sītāya jambucchāyāya nisinno vivicceva kāmehi
vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ
paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharitā. Siyā nu kho eso maggo
bodhāyāti._

(...) Following that memory came the insight

_tassa mayhaṃ aggivessana satānusāriviññāṇaṃ ahosi_

(...) 'This indeed is the way to enlightenment'

_esova maggo bodhāyā ti._
____

===== Personal viññāṇa: the bhikkhu Sāti

The bhikkhu Sāti used the term _viññāṇa_ to indicate his idea of a
personal _viññāṇa_, calling it _tadevidaṃ viññāṇaṃ_. This stands
opposed to what the Buddha called 'dependently arisen _viññāṇa_'
(_paṭiccasamuppannaṃ viññāṇaṃ_) in the following conversation:

[quote, M.1.258]
____
-- Bhante, as I understand the teaching explained by the Blessed One, it is
this personal _viññāṇa_ that roams and wanders the round of birth and
death, not another'

_ahaṃ bhante bhagavatā dhammaṃ desitaṃ ājānāmi yathā tadevidaṃ
viññāṇaṃ sandhāvati saṃsarati anaññan ti._

-- What is that _viññāṇa_, Sāti?

_Katamaṃ taṃ sāti viññāṇan ti_

-- Bhante, it is that which speaks and experiences and feels here and there the
karmic consequences of meritorious and demeritorious deeds

_yvāyaṃ bhante vado vedeyyo tatra tatra kalyāṇapāpakānaṃ kammānaṃ
vipākaṃ paṭisaṃvedetī ti_

-- Worthless man, to whom indeed have you known me to explain the teaching that
way? Worthless man, have I not in many ways stated that _viññāṇa_ is
dependently arisen; and that without necessary conditions there is no arising
of _viññāṇa_.

lying senseless like a log.

=== Viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ anantaṃ sabbato pabhaṃ

==== Renderings

- _viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ anantaṃ sabbato pabhaṃ_: the mind with no
attribute, boundless, altogether free of defilement

==== Introduction

===== Viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ = saññāvedayitanirodha

_Viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ anantaṃ sabbato pabhaṃ_ occurs in the
scriptures twice (D.1.223; M.1.329). Its meaning is unsettled. We will show
here that it means the ending of perception and sense impression
(_saññāvedayitanirodha_). Let us examine the phrase step by step.

1. The phrase cannot mean _nibbāna_ because although _anidassanaṃ_ is indeed
a synonym for _nibbāna_ (S.4.370), _nibbāna_ is never elsewhere in the
scriptures called _viññāṇaṃ_; and furthermore, _nibbāna_ is never
described as _sabbato pabhaṃ_. See synonyms of _nibbāna_ at S.4.368-373.

2. In the scriptures _pabhassara_ is commonly linked to _cittaṃ._ For example:
+
[quote, A.3.16-17]
____
the mind is pliable and workable and radiant

_cittaṃ mudu ca kammaniyañca pabhassarañca._
____
+
That the related word _pabhaṃ_ is linked in our verse to _viññāṇaṃ_
suggests that _viññāṇaṃ_ is the phenomenon more usually known as
_cittaṃ_. This is not greatly surprising because the two words are already
used as synonyms elsewhere in the scriptures. For example:
+
[quote, S.2.95]
____
That which is called 'mind' or 'cognition' or 'consciousness' arises as one
thing and ceases as another by day and by night.

_Yañca kho etaṃ bhikkhave vuccati cittaṃ iti pi mano iti pi
viññāṇaṃ iti pi taṃ rattiyā ca divasassa ca aññadeva uppajjati
aññaṃ nirujjhati._
____
+
Therefore the _viññāṇaṃ_ in our phrase might make more sense if
understood as _cittaṃ_. Accordingly, we will call it 'mind.'

3. _Anidassanaṃ_ can mean invisible. For example:
+
[quote, M.1.127]
____
Because empty space is formless and invisible; it is not easy to draw pictures
there

_ākāso arūpī anidassano tattha na sukaraṃ rūpaṃ likhituṃ._
____
+
However, PED gives nine meanings to _nidassana_ including 'attribute.'
Therefore we render _anidassana_ as 'with no attribute.'

4. If _viññāṇaṃ_ has no attribute, then _sabbato pabhaṃ_ cannot
rationally be rendered as 'altogether radiant.' We therefore adopt the _via
negativa_ approach. This is easily accomplished because in the scriptures
_pabhassara_ means liberation from defilement. For example:
+
[quote, A.1.10]
____
The mind is intrinsically radiant: it is defiled by extrinsic defilements

_Pabhassaramidaṃ bhikkhave cittaṃ tañca kho āgantukehi upakkilesehi
upakkiliṭṭhan ti._
____
+
Therefore _sabbato pabhaṃ_ can be rendered as 'altogether free of
defilement.' This is compatible with 'having no attribute.'

5. Our phrase is associated with the ending of all phenomena because it is
linked in its two references to these two statements:
+
[quote, D.1.223]
____
\a) Here denomination-and-bodily-form is completely ended

_Ettha nāmañca rūpañca asesaṃ uparujjhati._
____
+
[quote, M.1.329]
____
\b) It is not reached by the totality of everything

_sabbassa sabbattena ananubhūtaṃ._
____
+
These statements both suggest our phrase means the ending of perception and
sense impression (_saññāvedayitanirodha_) because:
+
[quote, M.1.53]
____
\a) _Nāma_ includes sense impression and perception

_Vedanā saññā cetanā phasso manasikāro idaṃ vuccatāvuso nāmaṃ._
____
+
\b) 'Everything' (_sabba_) by definition includes 'whatever sense impression
that arises due to mental sensation' (_yampidaṃ manosamphassapaccayā
uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ_, S.4.27).
+
Therefore our phrase implies a state 'not reached by' sense impression.

6. Our phrase is part of a five-line verse, which is quoted in full in the
Illustrations below. The last line of that verse includes the term 'the ending
of _viññāṇa_' (_viññāṇassa nirodhena_) (D.1.223). So whereas we are
researching the meaning of '_viññāṇa_ with no attribute' (_viññāṇaṃ
anidassanaṃ_), we are faced with the fact that it is equivalent to the ending
of _viññāṇa_. This appears to be a combination of incompatible terms,
unless the two _viññāṇas_ have different meanings. Since we have already
decided to call _viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ_ 'mind with no attribute,' let
us now quickly settle the meaning of the 'ending of _viññāṇa_.'

7. Since we have agreed that _viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ_ concerns the
ending of perception and sense impression (_saññāvedayitanirodha_),
therefore _viññāṇassa nirodhena_ means _saññāvedayitanirodhena_, the
ending of perception and sense impression_._

In conclusion, the mind with no attribute means the ending of perception and
sense impression.

===== Not to be confused: tadāyatanaṃ

_Viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ_ should not be confused with the following quote
in which these three phrases show that _nibbāna_ is meant:

1. supreme state of deliverance

2. no foundation

3. truly the end of suffering

The quote is this:

[quote, Ud.80]
____
There is that supreme state of deliverance where there is neither solidness,
liquidness, warmth, nor gaseousness; no state of awareness of boundless space,
no state of awareness of boundless mental consciousness, no state of awareness
of nonexistence, no state of awareness neither having nor lacking perception;
neither this world, nor a world beyond, nor both; neither sun nor moon. There,
I declare, there is no coming, no going, no staying, no passing away, no being
reborn. It is neither fixed, nor moving, and has no foundation. This is truly
the end of suffering.

_Atthi bhikkhave tadāyatanaṃ yattha neva paṭhavī na āpo na tejo na vāyo
na ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ na viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ na
ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ na nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṃ nāyaṃ loko na
paraloko na ubho candimasūriyā. Tatrāpāhaṃ bhikkhave neva āgatiṃ
vadāmi na gatiṃ na ṭhitiṃ na cutiṃ na upapattiṃ; appatiṭṭhaṃ
appavattaṃ anārammaṇamevetaṃ. Esevanto dukkhassā ti._

Here long and short, small and large, fair and foul, and
denomination-and-bodily-form are completely ended.

_Ettha dīghañca rassañca aṇuṃthūlaṃ subhāsubhaṃ; +
Ettha nāmañca rūpañca asesaṃ uparujjhati_

Through the ending of perception and sense impression, these are thereby
completely ended.

They did this by asking:

____
Why recite these lesser and minor training rules? They only lead to anxiety,
vexation, and perplexity.

_kiṃ panimehi khuddānukhuddakehi sikkhāpadehi uddiṭṭhehi yāvadve

____

The Buddha rebuked them:

____
How can you, worthless men, disparage the discipline?

_kathaṃ hi nāma tumhe moghapurisā vinayaṃ vivaṇṇessatha_
____

He established the rule:

[quote, Vin.4.143]
____
Whatever bhikkhu, when the Pātimokkha is being recited, should speak thus:
'Why recite these lesser and minor training rules? They only lead to anxiety,
vexation, and perplexity,' in disparaging a rule of training, there is an
offence of pācittiya."

_Yo pana bhikkhu pātimokkhe uddissamāne evaṃ vadeyya kiṃ panimehi

'I could question Upāli on the discipline'

MahāKassapa questioned Upāli on the subject of the first pārājika rule and
its provenance, on the individual, on what was laid down, on what was an
offence, and on what was no offence.

_Atha kho āyasmā mahākassapo āyasmantaṃ upāliṃ paṭhamassa

(...) In this same way he questioned him about both divisions (i.e. both
Pātimokkhas, bhikkhus' and bhikkhunīs')

_eteneva upāyena ubhato vibhaṅge pucchi._

[quote, M.3.233-4]
____
'One should know the analysis of pleasure, and knowing that, one should devote
oneself to inward pleasure.' So it was said. In reference to what was it said?

_Sukhavinicchayaṃ jaññā sukhavinicchayaṃ ñatvā ajjhattaṃ
sukhamanuyuñjeyyā'ti iti kho panetaṃ vuttaṃ kiñcetaṃ paṭicca
vuttaṃ:_

There are these five varieties of sensuous pleasure. What five? Visible objects
known via the visual sense... tangible objects known via the tactile sense that
are likeable, loveable, pleasing, agreeable, connected with sensuous pleasure,
and charming. These are the five varieties of sensuous pleasure.

_pañcime bhikkhave kāmaguṇā. Katame pañca: cakkhuviññeyyā rūpā...
kāyaviññeyyā poṭṭhabbā iṭṭhā kantā manāpā piyarūpā
kāmūpasaṃhitā rajanīyā. Ime kho bhikkhave pañcakāmaguṇā._

The physical and psychological pleasure that arises from the five varieties of
sensuous pleasure: this is called sensuous pleasure, a vile pleasure, the
pleasure of the common man, an ignoble pleasure. This pleasure should not be
pursued, developed, and cultivated, I declare. It should be feared.

_Yaṃ kho bhikkhave ime pañcakāmaguṇe paṭicca uppajjati sukhaṃ
somanassaṃ idaṃ vuccati kāmasukhaṃ mīḷhasukhaṃ puthujjanasukhaṃ
anariyasukhaṃ. Na āsevitabbaṃ na bhāvetabbaṃ na bahulīkātabbaṃ
bhāyitabbaṃ etassa sukhassāti vadāmi._

In this regard, secluded from sensuous pleasures and spiritually
unwholesome factors, a bhikkhu enters and abides in first jhāna... a bhikkhu
enters and abides in fourth jhāna.

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi
savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ
upasampajja viharati… catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati._

This is called the pleasure of the practice of unsensuousness, the pleasure of
physical seclusion, the pleasure of inward peace, the pleasure of
enlightenment. This pleasure should be pursued, developed, and cultivated, I
declare. It should not be feared.

_Idaṃ vuccati nekkhammasukhaṃ pavivekasukhaṃ upasamasukhaṃ
sambodhisukhaṃ āsevitabbaṃ bhāvetabbaṃ bahulīkātabbaṃ. Na
bhāyitabbaṃ etassa sukhassāti vadāmi._

'One should know the analysis of pleasure, and knowing that, one should devote
oneself to inward pleasure.' So it was said. It was in reference to this that
it was said.

==== Renderings

- _vippasannāni indriyāni_: serene [mental] faculties

- _indriyāni samathaṃ gatāni_: [mental] faculties calmed

- _santindriyāni_: peaceful [mental] faculties

==== Introduction

===== Which indriyāni?

The problem of assigning _indriyāni_ a meaning is summarised in PED's comment:

- 'It is often to be guessed from the context only, which of the sets of 5
_indriyāni_ is meant.'

The confusion over _vippasannāni indriyāni_ is obvious in DOP's comment as
follows, with which we disagree:

- 'The serenity of the senses is perceptible to others.'

In the present context we call _indriyāni_ '[mental] faculties', a rendering
unsupported by either of the dictionaries. In the suttas, the state of the
mental faculties is visible through its effect on firstly the countenance
(_mukhavaṇṇo_), and secondly, the complexion (_chavivaṇṇo_):

1. Moggallāna, friend, your [mental] faculties are serene, your countenance is
pure and bright. Venerable MahāMoggallāna surely spent today in a peaceful
abiding.

2. King Mahāsudassana's [mental] faculties are serene, his complexion is pure
and bright. May indeed he not be dead!

****

===== Linking vippasannāni indriyāni to citta: the Kāmada Sutta

Although many suttas support our rendering, irrefutable support comes from the
dialogue in the _Kāmada Sutta_, where _indriyūpasame_ is linked to _citta_,
as follows:

&#8203;[The young deva Kāmada:]

____
'That is hard to compose, Blessed One, namely, the mind.'

==== Correcting the texts

===== On reading vimuccati as adhimuccati

Both VRI and BJT Pāli editions agree that the word sequence _cittaṃ
pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati_ is followed by either _vimuccati_ or
_adhimuccati_. In every case we prefer _adhimuccati_. The commentaries support
us in two cases. The readings are as follows:

- D.3.240: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_ (Commentary: _Na vimuccatī ti
nādhimuccati_).

- M.1.186: _santiṭṭhati adhimuccati_

- M.1.435: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_

- M.3.104: _santiṭṭhati adhimuccati_

- M.3.112: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_

- A.2.166: _santiṭṭhati adhimuccati_

- A.3.245: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_ (Commentary: _Na vimuccatī ti na
adhimuccati_).

- A.4.235: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_

- A.4.438-48: _santiṭṭhati vimuccati_

===== Horner vs. Trenkner

Concerning the occurrence at M.1.435, Horner praises the reading _pakkhandati
pasīdati santiṭṭhati vimuccati_, saying:

- 'The compilers were right to vary the last of the four verbs.'

However, she admits that in saying so she contradicts Trenkner, who 'says he
should have adopted' _adhimuccati_.

===== Bodhi: adhimuccati 'makes better sense'

Bodhi supports Trenckner. In two notes to the _Aṅguttara_ references he says:

- 'Though all three editions here read _vimuccati_, Mp glosses the word with
_adhimuccati_. The latter makes better sense to me. The manuscript traditions,
as well as printed editions, show irregular variations between these two
readings throughout the Nikāyas.' (note to A.3.245, NDB n.1206).

- Mp glosses _vimuccati_ here as "liberated from the opposing qualities"
(_paccanlkadhammehi ca vimuccati_). Since all three editions, with the support
of Mp, have _vimuccati_, I translate in conformity with this reading, but I
think it likely that the original reading was _adhimuccati_, "resolved upon" or
"focused on." As the text unfolds with respect to the successive meditative
attainments, in each case the bodhisatta is _vimuccati/adhimuccati_ upon the
attainment before he actually achieves it. In such a context being "focused on"
rather than "liberated in" makes better sense (note to A.4.439, NDB n.1943).

===== Conclusion

At all references we follow Trenckner and Bodhi, reading _adhimuccati._

==== Liberation (from specified objects)

===== The vimuccati cognates: specified object

The _vimuccati_ cognates are associated with various specified objects. For
example:

===== 1) Vimuccituṃ: to be liberated (from all originated phenomena)

[quote, S.2.191]
____
It is time enough, bhikkhus, to be disillusioned with all originated phenomena,
to be unattached to them, to be liberated from them.

_Yāvañcidaṃ bhikkhave alameva sabbasaṅkhāresu nibbindituṃ alaṃ
virajjituṃ alaṃ vimuccituṃ._
____

===== 2) Vimutto, liberated (from being reckoned)

[quote, M.1.488]
____
The Perfect One is liberated from being reckoned in terms of bodily form...
advertence, Vaccha, he is profound, immeasurable, unfathomable like the ocean

_Rūpasaṅkhāvimutto... Viññāṇasaṅkhāvimutto kho vaccha tathāgato
gambhīro appameyyo duppariyogāho seyyathā pi mahāsamuddo._
____

===== 3) Vimuttan, liberated (from āsavas)

[quote, M.3.30]
____
Through being without grasping his mind was liberated from perceptually
obscuring states

_anupādāya āsavehi cittaṃ vimuttan ti._
____

===== Vimuccati means 'to be liberated [from perceptually obscuring states]'

Where there is no specified object, we render _vimutta_/_vimutti_ with
parenthesis: liberated/liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]. These
next two quotes support the parenthesis:

[quote, M.1.183-4]
____
For him thus knowing and seeing, his mind is liberated from perceptually
obscuring states due to pursuing sensuous pleasure, liberated from perceptually
obscuring states due to pursuing individual existence, and liberated from
perceptually obscuring states due to uninsightfulness into reality. Being
liberated [from perceptually obscuring states], the knowledge arises that he is
[thus] liberated.

_Tassa evaṃ jānato evaṃ passato kāmāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati
bhavāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati avijjāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati.
Vimuttasmiṃ vimuttami ti ñāṇaṃ hoti._
____

[quote, A.3.21]
____
This is the first occasion of liberation [from perceptually obscuring
states] in which, for a bhikkhu abiding diligently, vigorously, and resolutely
applied [to the practice], his unliberated mind is liberated [from perceptually
obscuring states], his undestroyed perceptually obscuring states are destroyed,
the unreached safety from the danger of bondage [to individual existence] is
reached.

_Idaṃ bhikkhave paṭhamaṃ vimuttāyatanaṃ yattha bhikkhuno
appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati

==== Temporary liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]

===== Introduction

_Vimutti/vimutta_ sometimes mean 'temporarily liberated,' and are then often
called _sāmayikaṃ vimuttiṃ_ or _samayavimutta_. Sometimes this needs
parenthesising, as in two of the following illustrations.

Comment:

The following quote shows that 'temporary liberation' means attaining the
jhānas:

____
Indeed, Ānanda, there is no possibility that a bhikkhu who finds enjoyment in
company... can be one who attains at will, without trouble, without difficulty,
that which is the pleasure of the practice of unsensuousness, the pleasure of
physical seclusion, the pleasure of inward peace, the pleasure of enlightenment.

In this regard, Kuṇḍaliya, seeing a pleasing visible object via the visual
sense, a bhikkhu does not long for it or get excited by it or become attached
to it.

_Idha kuṇḍaliya bhikkhu cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā manāpaṃ nābhijjhati

[from perceptually obscuring states].

_Atha kho āyasmā godhiko appamatto ātāpī pahitatto viharanto sāmayikaṃ
cetovimuttiṃ phusi. Atha kho āyasmā godhiko tāya sāmayikāya
cetovimuttiyā parihāyi._
____

Comment:

We discuss _cetovimutti_ sv _Cetovimutti_, but include this well-known quote to
show how _cetovimutti_ and _vimutti_ are sometimes synonyms. Just as _vimutti_
can be temporary, so can _cetovimutti_.

==== Perpetual liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]

===== Introduction: asamayavimutti

When _vimutti_ is 'perpetual' it is sometimes designated as such
(_asamayavimutti_) and is then equivalent to perpetual _vimokkha_:

[quote, M.1.197]
____
Being diligently applied [to the practice], he attains perpetual deliverance
[from perceptually obscuring states] (_asamayavimokkhaṃ ārādheti_). And it
is impossible for that bhikkhu to fall away from that perpetual liberation
[from perceptually obscuring states] (_asamayavimuttiyā parihāyetha_).

_Appamatto samāno asamayavimokkhaṃ ārādheti. Aṭṭhānametaṃ bhikkhave
anavakāso yaṃ so bhikkhu tāya asamayavimuttiyā parihāyetha._
____

In the quote above, even though _asamayavimuttiyā_ has no designated object,
other suttas say that _āsavas_ (perceptually obscuring states) are the object.
For example, in the following quote _vimuttacitto_ is defined as _cittaṃ
virajjati vimuccati anupādāya āsavehi_.

[quote, S.5.158]
____
In what way is one's mind liberated [from perceptually obscuring states]?

_kathañca sāriputta vimuttacitto hoti_

(...) In this regard a bhikkhu abides contemplating the nature of the body,
vigorously, fully consciously, and mindfully, having eliminated greed and
dejection in regard to the world [of phenomena]. As he abides contemplating the
nature of the body his mind is unattached [to originated phenomena], it is
liberated from perceptually obscuring states through being without grasping
(_cittaṃ virajjati vimuccati anupādāya āsavehi_).

_Idha sāriputta bhikkhu kāye kāyānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno
satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ tassa kāye kāyānupassino viharato
cittaṃ virajjati vimuccati anupādāya āsavehi._
____

Thus when _vimutta_ has no specified object, its object is 'perceptually
obscuring states' (_āsavas_).

===== Introduction: three synonymous formulations

Liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] is stated in three ways,
namely, with reference to the following liberated agents:

1. the stream of sense consciousness (_viññāṇa_).

2. a bhikkhu's mind (_citta_).

3. a bhikkhu (_bhikkhu_)

We illustrate this in three paragraphs:

===== 1) Liberation of the stream of sense consciousness (viññāṇa)

____
Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu has abandoned attachment to bodily form, with the
abandonment of attachment the basis is removed: there is no establishment of
his stream of sense consciousness.

_Rūpadhātuyā ce bhikkhave bhikkhuno rāgo pahīno hoti rāgassa pahānā
vocchijjatārammaṇaṃ patiṭṭhā viññāṇassa na hoti_
____

If he has abandoned attachment

- to the phenomenon of sense impression...

- to the phenomenon of perception...

- to the phenomenon of intentional activities...

- to the phenomenon of advertence,

[quote, S.3.53]
____
with the abandonment of attachment the basis is removed: there is no
establishment of his stream of sense consciousness.

_vedanādhātuyā .. saññādhātuyā... saṅkhāradhātuyā...
viññāṇadhātuyā ce bhikkhave bhikkhunā rāgo pahīno hoti. Rāgassa
pahānā vocchijjatārammaṇaṃ patiṭṭhā viññāṇassa na hoti_

When the stream of sense consciousness is unestablished, not [egoistically]
matured, without the performance of [karmically consequential deeds], it is
liberated [from perceptually obscuring states].

_tadappatiṭṭhitaṃ viññāṇaṃ avirūḷhaṃ anabhisaṅkhacca
vimuttaṃ._
____

===== 2) Liberation of a bhikkhu's mind (cittaṃ)

[quote, S.3.45]
____
If a bhikkhu's mind is unattached to bodily form... advertence, it is liberated
from perceptually obscuring states through being without grasping.

_Rūpadhātuyā... viññāṇadhātuyā ce bhikkhave bhikkhuno cittaṃ
virattaṃ vimuttaṃ hoti anupādāya āsavehi._
____

===== 3) Liberation of a bhikkhu

____
In this regard, having seen any kind of bodily form... advertence according to
reality with perfect penetrative discernment as "not [in reality] mine," "not
[in reality] what I am," "not my [absolute] Selfhood," a bhikkhu is liberated
[from perceptually obscuring states] through being without grasping.

_Idha aggivessana bhikkhu yaṃ kiñci rūpaṃ atītānāgata paccuppannaṃ
ajjhattaṃ vā bahiddhā vā oḷārikaṃ vā sukhumaṃ vā hīnaṃ vā

transcend the refined material states of awareness, and by seeing [reality]
with penetrative discernment, his perceptually obscuring states are destroyed.

=== Vimuttiñāṇadassana

==== Renderings

- _vimuttiñāṇadassana_: the knowledge and vision that follows liberation
[from perceptually obscuring states]

==== Introduction

===== Vimuttiñāṇadassana: finding the connective

_Vimuttiñāṇadassana_ is usually translated with the connective 'of':

- 'the knowledge and vision of liberation' (Bodhi, A.5.3)

- the knowledge and vision of freedom (Horner, M.1.146).

But the suttas do not say that liberation is associated with knowledge 'of'
liberation. They say that following liberation, the bhikkhu has the knowledge
'that' he is liberated, and 'that' birth is destroyed etc.:

[quote, M.3.108]
____
Being liberated [from perceptually obscuring states], the knowledge arises that
he is [thus] liberated. He knows that birth is destroyed; the religious life
has been fulfilled; what had to be done has been done; there will be no further
arising in any state of individual existence.

_Vimuttasmiṃ vimuttami ti ñāṇaṃ hoti. Khīṇā jāti vusitaṃ
brahmacariyaṃ kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ nāparaṃ itthattāyā ti pajānāti._
____

===== Vimutti equals āsavakkhaya

We have shown (sv _Vimutta_) that _vimutta_/_vimutti_ should be parenthesised:
liberated/liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]. We used this quote
to demonstrate this:

[quote, M.1.183-4]
____
For him thus knowing and seeing, his mind is liberated from perceptually
obscuring states due to pursuing sensuous pleasure, liberated from perceptually
obscuring states due to pursuing individual existence, and liberated from
perceptually obscuring states due to uninsightfulness into reality. Being
liberated [from perceptually obscuring states], the knowledge arises that he is
[thus] liberated.

_Tassa evaṃ jānato evaṃ passato kāmāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati
bhavāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati avijjāsavāpi cittaṃ vimuccati.
Vimuttasmiṃ vimuttami ti ñāṇaṃ hoti._
____

In other words, _vimutti_ equals _āsavakkhaya_, as further indicated in this
quote:

[quote, A.3.21]
____
This is the first occasion of liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]
in which, for a bhikkhu abiding diligently, vigorously, and resolutely applied
[to the practice], his unliberated mind is liberated [from perceptually
obscuring states], his undestroyed perceptually obscuring states are destroyed,
the unreached safety from the danger of bondage [to individual existence] is
reached._

_Idaṃ bhikkhave paṭhamaṃ vimuttāyatanaṃ yattha bhikkhuno appamattassa
ātāpino pahitattassa viharato avimuttaṃ vā cittaṃ vimuccati
aparikkhīṇā vā āsavā parikkhayaṃ gacchanti ananuppattaṃ vā
anuttaraṃ yogakkhemaṃ anupāpuṇāti._
____

===== Vimuttiñāṇadassanakkhandha implies multiplicity

_Vimuttiñāṇadassana_ is one of the five aggregates that should be realised
for oneself: _Katame pañca dhammā sacchikātabbā? Pañca dhammakkhandhā:
sīlakkhandho samādhikkhandho paññākkhandho vimuttikkhandho
vimuttiñāṇadassanakkhandho_ (D.3.279).

Following his enlightenment, the Buddha said that he sought to perfect each of
these five aggregates. For example, he said:

[quote, S.1.139]
____
It would be for the sake of fulfilling the unfulfilled aggregate of the
knowledge and vision that follows liberation [from perceptually obscuring
states] that I would honour, respect, and dwell under another ascetic or
brahman in spiritual discipleship. But I do not see another ascetic or brahman
in the world [of beings] with its devas, māras, and brahmās, in the world of
mankind with its ascetics and Brahmanists, its royalty and commoners who is
more perfect that I in the knowledge and vision that follows liberation [from
perceptually obscuring states] that I could honour, respect, and dwell under in
spiritual discipleship.

_aparipuṇṇassa kho vimuttiñāṇadassanakkhandhassa pāripuriyā aññaṃ
samaṇaṃ vā brāhmaṇaṃ vā sakkatvā garukatvā upanissāya
vihareyyaṃ. na kho panāhaṃ passāmi sadevake loke samārake sabrahmake
sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya attanā vimutti
ñāṇadassanasampannataraṃ aññaṃ samaṇaṃ vā brāhmaṇaṃ vā
yamahaṃ sakkatvā garukatvā upanissāya vihareyyaṃ._
____

If _vimuttiñāṇadassana_ is an aggregate, it is a group of knowledges. It
cannot be simply 'knowledge and vision of liberation.'

===== Vimuttiñāṇadassana before enlightenment

_Vimuttiñāṇadassana_ is usually associated with arahants. However, the
Buddha's question to the unenlightened Ānanda indicates that it may be
operative even before enlightenment:

[quote, S.5.162]
____
'Why, Ānanda, when Sāriputta passed away, did he take away your aggregate of
virtuous practices, inward collectedness, penetrative discernment, liberation
[from perceptually obscuring states], and the knowledge and vision that follows
liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]?' 'No, bhante.'

_Kinnu kho te ānanda sāriputto sīlakkhandhaṃ vā ādāya parinibbuto
samādhikkhandhaṃ vā ādāya parinibbuto paññākkhandhaṃ vā ādāya
parinibbuto vimuttikkhandhaṃ vā ādāya parinibbuto
vimuttiñāṇadassanakkhandhaṃ vā ādāya parinibbuto ti? Na kho me bhante._
____

Although the destruction of perceptually obscuring states (_āsavakkhaya_) is
prominently associated with arahantship, _āsavas_ are in fact destroyed from
stream-entry onwards. The three types of individuals who are at least
stream-enterers but not arahants are called _kāyasakkhī, diṭṭhappatto_
and _saddhāvimutto._ The _Kīṭāgiri Sutta_ (M.1.438) says that for each of
these individuals some of his perceptually obscuring states are destroyed
(_ekacce āsavā parikkhīṇā honti_). Therefore
_vimuttiñāṇadassanakkhandha_ likely begins at stream-entry. Before
stream-entry, no perceptually obscuring states are destroyed (_āsavā
aparikkhīṇā honti_, M.1.479).

===== The knowledge and vision that follows liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]: further aspects

If _vimuttiñāṇadassana_ is an aggregate, then it has various of its aspects
of knowledge that become apparent to an arahant, and perhaps even before that.
We have already noted various instances of knowledge in this quote:

[quote, M.3.108]
____
Being liberated [from perceptually obscuring states], the knowledge arises that
he is [thus] liberated. He knows that birth is destroyed; the religious life
has been fulfilled; what had to be done has been done; there will be no further
arising in any state of individual existence.

_Vimuttasmiṃ vimuttami ti ñāṇaṃ hoti. Khīṇā jāti vusitaṃ
brahmacariyaṃ kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ nāparaṃ itthattāyā ti pajānāti._
____

Other instances of knowledge are given as the conclusion of other suttas:

1. He knows that birth is destroyed; the religious life has been fulfilled;
what had to be done has been done; there will be no further arising in any
state of individual existence. This, too, is called a footprint of the Perfect
One, a scratch mark of the Perfect One, a tusk slash of the Perfect One. And it
is not until this point that a noble disciple can come to the conclusion: 'The
Blessed One is perfectly enlightened; the teaching is well explained by the
Blessed One; the community of the Blessed One's disciples is applied to an
excellent practice.

****

[quote, M.3.108]
____
He knows that whatever states of suffering there are because of perceptual
obscuration due to pursuing sensuous pleasure, of perceptual obscuration due to
pursuing individual existence, and of perceptual obscuration due to
uninsightfulness into reality, are absent. And there is only this amount of
suffering, namely what is connected with the six senses which are dependent on
the body and have life as their necessary condition.

_So evaṃ pajānāti ye assu darathā kāmāsavaṃ paṭicca tedha na santi
ye assu darathā bhavāsavaṃ paṭicca tedha na santi ye assu darathā
avijjāsavaṃ paṭicca tedha na santi atthi cevāyaṃ darathamattā
yadidaṃ imameva kāyaṃ paṭicca saḷāyatanikaṃ jīvitapaccayā ti._

He knows that "This state of perception is void of perceptual obscuration due
to pursuing sensuous pleasure, of perceptual obscuration due to pursuing
individual existence, and of perceptual obscuration due to uninsightfulness
into reality. And there is just this state which is not absent, namely what is
connected with the six senses which are dependent on the body and have life as
their necessary condition. He regards it as void of whatever is not there. Of
the remainder, he discerns: "That [absence] being, this [relative voidness]
is." This is for him the undistorted, pure, supreme, unsurpassed realisation of
[the perception of] [relative] voidness according to reality.

_So suññamidaṃ saññāgataṃ kāmāsavenā ti pajānāti suññamidaṃ
saññāgataṃ bhavāsavenā ti pajānāti suññamidaṃ saññāgataṃ

=== Vimokkha

==== Renderings

- _vimokkha_: deliverance [from perceptually obscuring states]

- _vimokkha_: state of refined awareness

- _saññāvimokkha_: deliverance from perception

- _vimokkho cetaso:_ deliverance of the mind [from individual existence]

==== Introduction

===== Vimokkha: arahantship

_Vimokkha_ occasionally means arahantship:

[quote, M.2.265]
____
This is the Deathless, namely the mind's deliverance [from perceptually
obscuring states] through being without grasping.

_etaṃ amataṃ yadidaṃ anupādā cittassa vimokkho._
____

Sometimes this is called 'perpetual' and it is then equivalent to perpetual
_vimutti_:

[quote, M.1.197]
____
Being diligently applied [to the practice], he attains perpetual deliverance
[from perceptually obscuring states] (_asamayavimokkhaṃ ārādheti_). And it
is impossible for that bhikkhu to fall away from that perpetual liberation
[from perceptually obscuring states] (_asamayavimuttiyā parihāyetha_).

_Appamatto samāno asamayavimokkhaṃ ārādheti. Aṭṭhānametaṃ bhikkhave
anavakāso yaṃ so bhikkhu tāya asamayavimuttiyā parihāyetha._
____

Cases where _vimokkha_ is not perpetual will be presented below.

===== Vimokkha of arahantship: deliverance [from perceptually obscuring states]

Although in the cases mentioned, _vimokkho_ has no specified object, the
scriptures show that _āsavas_ (perceptually obscuring states) are the object,
therefore in English, that parenthesis should be used. For example, in this
conversation:

-- 'But, Sāriputta, if they were to ask you: 'Sāriputta, friend, through what
state of deliverance (_kathaṃ vimokkhā_) have you declared your [attainment
of] arahantship (_aññā vyākatā_) thus: "I know that birth is destroyed;
the religious life has been fulfilled; what had to be done has been done; there
will be no further arising in any state of individual existence?" Being asked
thus, how would you answer?'

-- 'If they were to ask me this, bhante, I would answer thus: "Friends,

____
through an internal deliverance [from perceptually obscuring states]

_ajjhattavimokkhā khvāhaṃ āvuso_

through the destruction of all grasping _

_sabbūpādānakkhayā_

I abide mindfully in such a way that perceptually obscuring states (_āsavā_)
do not pursue me

_tathā sato viharāmi yathā sataṃ viharantaṃ āsavā nānussavanti_

and I do not despise myself."_

_attānañca nāvajānāmī ti_
____

Being asked thus, bhante, I would answer in such a way.'

[quote, S.2.54]
____
-- 'Very good, Sāriputta! And this is another way of explaining in brief that
same point

_ayampi kho sāriputta pariyāyo etasseva atthassa saṅkhittena
veyyākaraṇāya_

"I am not unsure about the perceptually obscuring states spoken of by the
Ascetic

_ye āsavā samaṇena vuttā tesvāhaṃ na kaṅkhāmi_

I do not doubt they have been abandoned by me"

_te me pahīṇāti na vicikicchāmī ti._
____

===== Vimokkha: eight states of refined awareness:

_Vimokkha_ usually means the eight _vimokkhas_ (_aṭṭha vimokkhā_). These
correspond to the four jhānas, the four immaterial states and the ending of
perception and sense impression (_saññāvedayitanirodhaṃ_).

'Immaterial states' (_āruppā_, D.3.224) is the shorter term for 'the
immaterial states of awareness, those peaceful states of refined awareness that
transcend the refined material states of awareness' (_santā vimokkhā
atikkamma rūpe āruppā_) (M.1.34).

===== The eight vimokkhas

Here we list the eight _vimokkhas_. We call _vimokkha_ 'state of refined
awareness,' and will explain this in due course.

____
There are eight states of refined awareness

_Aṭṭhime bhikkhave vimokkhā katame aṭṭha:_
____

1. Being in a refined material state of awareness, one sees visible objects.
This is the first state of refined awareness
+
****
_Rūpī rūpāni passati. Ayaṃ paṭhamo vimokkho._
****

2. Being in an immaterial state of awareness, one sees visible objects. This is
the second state of refined awareness
+
****
_Ajjhattaṃ arūpasaññī eko bahiddhā rūpāni passati. Ayaṃ dutiyo
vimokkho._
****

3. One is focused exclusively on the Exquisite. This is the third state of
refined awareness
+
****
_Subhanteva adhimutto hoti. Ayaṃ tatiyo vimokkho._
****

4. By completely transcending refined material states of awareness, with the
vanishing of states of refined awareness involving physical sensation, not
focusing upon states of refined awareness involving the external senses, one
enters and abides in the state of awareness of boundless space where one
perceives that space is boundless. This is the fourth state of refined awareness
+
****
_Sabbaso rūpasaññānaṃ samatikkamā paṭighasaññānaṃ atthaṅgamā
nānattasaññānaṃ amanasikārā ananto ākāso ti ākāsanañcāyatanaṃ
upasampajja viharati. Ayaṃ catuttho vimokkho._
****

5. By completely transcending the state of awareness of boundless space, one
enters and abides in the state of awareness of boundless mental consciousness,
where one perceives that mental consciousness is boundless. This is the fifth
state of refined awareness
+
****
_Sabbaso ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ samatikkamma anantaṃ viññāṇan ti
viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati. Ayaṃ pañcamo vimokkho._

===== The vimokkhās are 'levels of refined awareness': the Poṭṭhapāda Sutta

The _Poṭṭhapāda Sutta_ shows why we call the eight _vimokkhas_ 'states of
refined awareness' (_saññā_), because this is the term it uses:

____
Secluded from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors, he enters
and abides in first jhāna, which is accompanied by thinking and pondering, and
rapture and physical pleasure born of seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and
spiritually unwholesome factors].

_So vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ
vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati._

(...) For him the mental imagery of previous sensuous pleasure ceases.

_Tassa yā purimā kāmasaññā sā nirujjhati._

(...) And at that time there is a subtle but true perception of the rapture and
physical pleasure born of seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually
unwholesome factors]. He is one with a subtle but true perception of the
rapture and physical pleasure born of seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and
spiritually unwholesome factors].

_Vivekajapītisukhasukhumasaccasaññā tasmiṃ samaye hoti.
Vivekajapītisukhasukhumasaccasaññī yeva tasmiṃ samaye hoti._

(...) In this way one state of refined awareness arises through the training, and
one state of refined awareness ceases through the training. And that is the
training, said the Blessed One...

_Evampi sikkhā ekā saññā uppajjati. Sikkhā ekā saññā nirujjhati.
Ayaṃ sikkhā ti bhagavā avoca..._
____

(...) and so on, through the jhānas, up to the state of awareness of boundless
mental consciousness (_viññāṇañcāyatana_). Then the sutta continues:

[quote, D.1.183-4]
____
(...) Further, Poṭṭhapāda, by completely transcending the state of awareness
of boundless mental consciousness, he enters and abides in the state of
awareness of nonexistence, where one perceives that there is [nowhere] anything
at all, and the previous subtle but true perception of the state of awareness
of boundless mental consciousness ceases. And at that time there is a subtle
but true perception of the state of awareness of nonexistence. He is one with a
subtle but true perception of the state of awareness of nonexistence.

_Puna ca paraṃ poṭṭhapāda bhikkhu sabbaso viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ
samatikkamma natthi kiñcī ti ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati.
Tassa yā purimā viññāṇañcāyatanasukhumasaccasaññā sā nirujjhati.
Ākiñcaññāyatanasukhumasaccasaññā tasmiṃ samaye hoti.
Ākiñcaññāyatanasukhumasaccasaññiyeva tasmiṃ samaye hoti._

(...) In this way one state of refined awareness arises through the training, and
one state of refined awareness ceases through the training. And that is the
training, said the Blessed One.

_Evampi sikkhā ekā saññā uppajjati. Sikkhā ekā saññā nirujjhati.
Ayampi sikkhā ti bhagavā avoca._

(...) Poṭṭhapāda, once the bhikkhu is possessed of that preliminary state of
refined awareness, he proceeds from stage to stage till he reaches the highest
state of refined awareness.

_Yato kho poṭṭhapāda bhikkhu idha sakasaññī hoti so tato amutra tato
amutra anupubbena saññaggaṃ phusati._

(...) He attains to the ending [of originated phenomena].

_So nirodhaṃ phusati._

And that, Poṭṭhapāda, is how the ending of successively refined states of
refined awareness is attained in full consciousness.

_Evaṃ kho poṭṭhapāda anupubbābhisaññānirodhasampajānasamāpatti
hoti._
____

===== Vimokkha: the Commentary

We will now discuss why _vimokkhas_ are called 'deliverances.' This meaning is
a mystery even to the Commentary, because it explains the _vimokkhas_ as
follows:

[quote, "tr. Bodhi, NDB n.1776"]
____
'In what sense are they emancipations? In the sense of releasing. In what sense
releasing? In the sense of thoroughly freeing from adverse qualities, and in
the sense of thoroughly freeing through delight in the object. What is meant is
[the mind's] occurrence on the object without constraint, free from worry, like
a child sleeping on his father's lap, his body completely relaxed.'

_Vimokkhāti kenaṭṭhena vimokkhā? Adhimuccanaṭṭhena. Ko panāyaṃ
adhimuccanaṭṭho nāma? Paccanīkadhammehi ca suṭṭhu muccanaṭṭho
ārammaṇe ca abhirativasena suṭṭhu muccanaṭṭho pituaṅke
vissaṭṭhaṅgapaccaṅgassa dārakassa sayanaṃ viya aniggahitabhāvena
nirāsaṅkatāya ārammaṇe pavattīti vuttaṃ hoti._
____

But the 'adverse qualities' which are overcome by the eight _vimokkhās_ are
none other than the _vimokkhās_ themselves. This is made clear in the
_Sambādha Sutta_ which we now consider.

===== Sambādha Sutta (A.4.450): meaning of sambādho

The _Sambādha Sutta_ states that the jhānas and immaterial states are
_sambādho_. Ordinarily this word means 'crowded,' but in the figurative sense
PED calls it 'difficulty, trouble.' In the _Sambādha Sutta_ we accordingly
render it as 'trouble' or 'something troublesome' or 'what is troublesome,' and
the adjective as 'troublesome.'

===== Sambādha Sutta: the troublesomeness of jhānas and immaterial states

The _Sambādha Sutta_ concerns the deliverance from troublesome states of
refined awareness through more refined states of refined awareness. Having
considered this sutta, we will see that the eight _vimokkhas_ are deliverances
in the same sense.

The _Sambādha Sutta_ is as follows:

[quote, A.4.450-1]
____
The five varieties of sensuous pleasure are called inwardly troublesome by the
Blessed One.

_Ime kho āvuso pañcakāmaguṇā sambādho vutto bhagavatā._

(...) In this regard a bhikkhu, secluded from sensuous pleasures and spiritually
unwholesome factors, enters and abides in first jhāna, which is accompanied by
thinking and pondering, and rapture and physical pleasure born of seclusion
[from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors].

_Idhāvuso bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ
savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja
viharati._

(...) It is in reference to this that a deliverance from what is inwardly
troublesome is spoken of by the Blessed One, in a way that is qualified,
because again there is something inwardly troublesome.

_Ettāvatā pi kho āvuso sambādhe okāsādhigamo vutto bhagavatā
pariyāyena. Tattha'patthi sambādho._

(...) What is troublesome in this case?_

_Kiñca tattha sambādho?_

(...) The thinking and pondering that are unended is troublesome in this case._

_Yadeva tattha vitakkavicārā aniruddhā honti ayamettha sambādho._

(...) Again, in this regard, with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, and
[the development of] internal serenity and concentration, a bhikkhu enters and
abides in second jhāna which is without thinking and pondering, and is filled
with rapture and physical pleasure born of inward collectedness.

_Puna ca paraṃ āvuso bhikkhu vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā ajjhattaṃ
sampasādanaṃ cetaso ekodibhāvaṃ avitakkaṃ avicāraṃ samādhijaṃ
pītisukhaṃ dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati._

(...) It is in reference to this that a deliverance from what is inwardly
troublesome is spoken of by the Blessed One, in a way that is qualified,
because again there is something inwardly troublesome.

_Ettāvatā pi kho āvuso sambādhe okāsādhigamo vutto bhagavatā
pariyāyena. Tattha'patthi sambādho._

(...) What is troublesome in this case?_

_Kiñca tattha sambādho?_

(...) The rapture that is unended is troublesome in this case._

_Yadeva tattha pīti aniruddhā hoti ayamettha sambādho._

(...) Again, in this regard, with the fading away of rapture, a bhikkhu abides
serene, mindful, and fully conscious, experiencing physical pleasure. He enters
and abides in third jhāna in which the Noble Ones declare that he abides
serene, mindful, and in physical pleasure._

_Puna ca paraṃ āvuso pītiyā ca virāgā upekkhako ca viharati sato ca
sampajāno sukhañca kāyena paṭisaṃvedeti yantaṃ ariyā ācikkhanti
upekkhako satimā sukhavihārīti taṃ tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja
viharati._

(...) It is in reference to this that a deliverance from what is inwardly
troublesome is spoken of by the Blessed One, in a way that is qualified,
because again there is something inwardly troublesome.

pariyāyena. Tattha'patthi sambādho._

(...) What is troublesome in this case?_

_Kiñca tattha sambādho?_

(...) The serenity with physical pleasure that is unended is troublesome in this
case._

_Yadeva tattha upekkhāsukhaṃ aniruddhaṃ hoti ayamettha sambādho._

(...) Again, in this regard, with the abandonment of physical pleasure and pain,
and following the vanishing of psychological pleasure and pain, a bhikkhu
enters and abides in fourth jhāna, which is free of pleasure and pain, and [is
imbued with] purified detached awareness and mindfulness.

_Puna ca paraṃ āvuso bhikkhu sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā
pubbeva somanassadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamā adukkhamasukhaṃ
upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati._

(...) It is in reference to this that a deliverance from what is inwardly
troublesome is spoken of by the Blessed One, in a way that is qualified,

(...) The perception of the refined material states of awareness that is unended
is troublesome in this case._

(...) Again, in this regard, by completely transcending refined material states
of awareness, with the vanishing of states of refined awareness involving
physical sensation, not focusing upon states of refined awareness involving the
external senses, a bhikkhu enters and abides in the state of awareness of
boundless space where one perceives that space is boundless.

_Puna ca paraṃ āvuso bhikkhu sabbaso rūpasaññānaṃ samatikkamā
paṭighasaññānaṃ atthaṅgamā nānattasaññānaṃ amanasikārā ananto
ākāso ti ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati._

(...) Again, in this regard, by completely transcending the state of awareness of
boundless space, a bhikkhu enters and abides in the state of awareness of
boundless mental consciousness, where one perceives that mental consciousness
is boundless.

_Puna ca paraṃ āvuso bhikkhu sabbaso ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ samatikkamma
anantaṃ viññāṇan ti viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati._

===== What to call vimokkha?

The _Sambādha Sutta_ concerns the deliverances from the troublesomeness
associated with states of refined awareness by attaining more refined states of
refined awareness. If the eight _vimokkhas_ are considered deliverances in the
same sense, it explains why they have been called deliverances. We will now
discuss why we do not call them 'deliverances,' but instead call them 'states
of refined awareness.'

Let us first translate the list of _vimokkhas_ as 'deliverances [from
troublesomeness through states of refined awareness],' and we will see, and
then resolve, the cumbersomeness it creates:

____
There are eight deliverances [from troublesomeness through states of refined
awareness].

_Aṭṭhime bhikkhave vimokkhā katame aṭṭha:_
____

1. Being in a refined material state of awareness, one sees visible objects.
This is the first deliverance [from troublesomeness through states of refined
awareness].
+
****
_Rūpī rūpāni passati. Ayaṃ paṭhamo vimokkho._
****

2. Being in an immaterial state of awareness, one sees visible objects. This is
the second deliverance [from troublesomeness through states of refined
awareness].
+
****
_Ajjhattaṃ arūpasaññī eko bahiddhā rūpāni passati. Ayaṃ dutiyo
vimokkho._
****

It is cumbersome to label _vimokkha_ like this, and it adds nothing to the
understanding of the text. Accordingly, we label _vimokkha_ as 'state of
refined awareness.' That is:

1. Being in a refined material state of awareness, one sees visible objects.
This is the first state of refined awareness.
+
****
_Rūpī rūpāni passati. Ayaṃ paṭhamo vimokkho._
****

2. Being in an immaterial state of awareness, one sees visible objects. This is
the second state of refined awareness.
+
****
_Ajjhattaṃ arūpasaññī eko bahiddhā rūpāni passati. Ayaṃ dutiyo
vimokkho._
****

===== Vimokkho cetaso: deliverance of his mind [from individual existence]

At the passing away of the Buddha, Venerable Anuruddha said:

[quote, S.1.159]
____
The deliverance of his mind [from individual existence] was like the quenching
of a lamp

_pajjotasseva nibbānaṃ vimokkho cetaso ahūti._
____

Here we parenthesise '[from individual existence]' because when the arahant
dies, states of individual existence altogether cease:

[quote, It.38-9]
____
These two aspects of the Untroubled were made known by the Seer, free of
attachment, and of excellent qualities.

_Duve imā cakkhumatā pakāsitā +
Nibbānadhātu anissitena tādinā_

(...) One aspect is realisable in this lifetime, with residue, but with the
conduit to renewed states of individual existence destroyed;

_Ekā hi dhātu idha diṭṭhadhammikā +
Saupādisesā bhavanettisaṅkhayā._

(...) The other, having no residue, is that wherein states of individual
existence altogether cease.

_Anupādisesā pana samparāyikā +
Yamhi nirujjhanti bhavāni sabbaso._

_Saññāvimokkhe parame_: 'through the highest deliverance from perception.'
Although perception ceases with the ending of perception and sense impression
(_saññāvedayitaṃ nirodhaṃ_), the 'highest deliverance' would be
arahantship, which lies beyond it. This is confirmed by the statement 'not
subject to [renewed states of individual existence]' in the next verse.

=== Virāga

==== Renderings

- _virāga_: fading away

- _virāga_: passing away

- _virāga_: the passing away [of originated phenomena]

- _virāga_: evanescent

- _virāgadhamma_: destined to pass away

- _virāga_: non-attachment

- _virāga_: non-attachment [to originated phenomena]

==== Introduction

===== Virāga: two meanings

_Virāga_ has two broad meanings:

1. 'Non-attachment,' the opposite of attachment (_rāga_).

2. 'Fading away' or 'passing away.' Accordingly, PED says _virāgin_ means
'fading in colour', and _rāgavirāgin,_ 'fading in the original dye' (sv
_Virāgin_).

===== Virāga without a specified object

_Virāga_ commonly has no specified object. This same issue arises with
_nirodha_, and has been discussed sv _Nirodha_, and we resolve it in the same
way, namely, that 'originated phenomena' is taken as the object. Proof for this
was given for _nirodha_, and we extend it here to _virāga_ because of the
common association of the two words, for example in this phrase:

[quote, A.3.164]
____
Destruction of craving, the passing away [of originated phenomena], the ending
[of originated phenomena], the Untroubled.

_taṇhakkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānaṃ._
____

We apply the same parenthesis where _virāga_ means 'non-attachment':

[quote, Th.v.599]
____
The black crow dwelling [and feasting] in its home in the charnel ground
arouses mindfulness in me regarding the body that conduces to non-attachment
[to originated phenomena].

_Apaṇḍaro aṇḍasambhavo sīvathikāya niketacāriko uppādayātava me
satiṃ sandehasmiṃ virāganissitaṃ._
____

===== Association with nibbidā: non-attachment

When _virāga_ is associated with _nibbidā_ ('disillusionment'), the context
demands that is is rendered as 'non-attachment', not 'fading or passing away':

[quote, S.2.18]
____
If a bhikkhu is applying himself to disillusionment with old age and death, to
non-attachment to it, and to the ending of it, he is fit to be called a bhikkhu
who is practising in accordance with the teaching.

_Jarāmaraṇassa ce bhikkhu nibbidāya virāgāya nirodhāya paṭipanno hoti
dhammānudhammapaṭipanno bhikkhū ti alaṃ vacanāya._
____

Otherwise, the context demands that is is rendered as 'fading or passing away'
not 'non-attachment.' For example:

1. But with the complete fading away and ending of this craving comes the
ending of grasping.
+
****
_tassāyeva taṇhāya asesavirāganirodhā upādānanirodho_ (S.2.73; S.4.87).
****

2. With the destruction of all forms of craving comes the complete passing away
and ending [of originated phenomena], the Untroubled.
+
****
_sabbaso taṇhānaṃ khayā asesavirāganirodho nibbānaṃ_ (Ud.32-3).
****

===== Virāga in mindfulness with breathing

In mindfulness with breathing _virāga_ occurs without an object:

____
I will breathe in... I will breathe out contemplating passing away_._

_virāgānupassī assasissāmī ti sikkhati_
____

The discussion above would support this being parenthesised: 'I will breathe
in... I will breathe out contemplating the passing away [of originated
phenomena].' However, the object is already allocated in the _Kimbila Sutta_
(S.5.325) and _Ānāpānasati Sutta_ (M.3.78):

[quote, S.5.325]
____
When a bhikkhu is training himself to breathe in and breathe out contemplating
passing away, at that time he abides contemplating the nature of certain
objects of the systematic teachings.

_Yasmiṃ samaye ānanda bhikkhu... virāgānupassī assasissāmī ti sikkhati
virāgānupassī passasissāmī ti sikkhati... dhammesu dhammānupassī ānanda
bhikkhu tasmiṃ samaye viharati._
____

'The phrase should be parenthesised accordingly:

____
I will breathe in... I will breathe out contemplating passing away [in relation
to certain objects of the systematic teachings].

_virāgānupassī assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti sikkhati_
____

The 'objects of the systematic teachings' are listed in the _Satipaṭṭhāna
Sutta_:

[quote, M.1.59-62]
____
In this regard a bhikkhu abides contemplating the nature of certain objects of
the systematic teachings in respect of the five hindrances... the five
aggregates... the six senses and their objects... the seven enlightenment
factors... the four noble truths.

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati pañcasu
nīvaraṇesu... pañcasupādānakkhandhesu... chasu ajjhattikabāhiresu
āyatanesu... sattasu bojjhaṅgesu... catusu ariyasaccesu._
____

We discuss this same issue sv _Paṭinissaggānupassī assasissāmī ti
sikkhati_.

===== Virāga as adjective

_Virāga_ as an adjective we say 'evanescent':

[quote, M.3.31]
____
Knowing bodily form to be powerless, evanescent, and unconsoling

_rūpaṃ kho ahaṃ āvuso abalaṃ virāgaṃ anassāsikan ti viditvā._
____

Comment:

This chapter of the _Saṃyutta Nikāya_ concerns synonyms of _nibbāna_, where
_virāga_ is not associated with _nibbidā_, so it is in accordance with the

_Virāga_ is not associated here with _nibbidā_, so it is in accordance with

===== Āraddhaviriyo: energetically applied

_Āraddhaviriyo_ means being somehow energetically applied, for example to the
supreme goal:

[quote, Sn.v.68]
____
One who is energetically applied to the attainment of the supreme goal.

_Āraddhaviriyo paramatthapattiyā._
____

Where _āraddhaviriyo_ occurs without qualification, we qualify it with 'to the
practice' in accordance with this definition:

[quote, S.2.276]
____
"One who is energetically applied [to the practice], one who is energetically
applied [to the practice]" is said. On what grounds is one energetically
applied [to the practice]?

_āraddhaviriyo āraddhaviriyo ti bhante vuccati. Kittāvatā nu kho bhante
āraddhaviriyo hotī ti?_

(...) 'In this regard, Moggallāna, a bhikkhu abides energetically thus:
"Willingly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and
blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not
attained what can be attained by manly strength, by manly energy, by manly
application [to the practice].

_idha moggallāna bhikkhu āraddhaviriyo viharati kāmaṃ taco ca nahārū ca

purisathāmena purisaviriyena purisaparakkamena pattabbaṃ na taṃ

(...) In this way is one energetically applied [to the practice].

_Evaṃ kho moggallāna āraddhaviriyo hotī ti._

For the rendering 'application [to the practice]' for _parakkama_, see Glossary
sv _Parakkama_.

===== Viriyasambojjhaṅga: the enlightenment factor of energetic application [to the practice]

That _viriyasambojjhaṅga_ means 'the enlightenment factor of energetic
application [to the practice]' can be judged from the following two quotes:

1. "While he scrutinises the teaching with penetrative discernment, examines
it, inquires into it, unflagging energy is aroused. Whenever a bhikkhu's
unflagging energy is aroused as he scrutinises the teaching with penetrative
discernment, examines it, inquires into it, on that occasion the enlightenment
factor of energetic application [to the practice] is aroused in the bhikkhu; on
that occasion the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of energetic
application [to the practice]; on that occasion the enlightenment factor of
energetic application [to the practice] is perfected through spiritual
cultivation in the bhikkhu.

2. On an occasion when the mind becomes sluggish, it is timely to develop...
the enlightenment factor of energetic application [to the practice]... For what
reason? Because the mind is sluggish.

****

===== Viriyindriya: faculty of energetic application [to the practice]

That _viriyindriya_ means 'the faculty of energetic application [to the
practice]' can be judged from this quote:

[quote, S.5.225]
____

through inward calm] and the liberation [from uninsightfulness] through
penetrative discernment, where those unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome

grasping

=== Vivaṭṭacchadda

==== Renderings

- _vivaṭṭacchadda_: completely renounced the round of rebirth

==== Introduction

===== Analysis: context better than etymology

_Vivaṭṭacchaddo_ has long been a subject of debate. Because even its
spelling is unsettled, resolving its meaning must be primarily based on
context, not etymology. Extensive notes that demonstrate the longstanding
interest in this term can be found at:

- PED: under _Vivattacchada_

- Norman: Group of Discourses p.229 n.372

- Bodhi: NDB n.713.

- Bodhi: MLDB n.853

===== 'Removed the covering': neologism

Many commentaries say _vivaṭṭacchadda_ means 'one who has removed the
covering,' as follows:

[quote, "Sv.1.250, tr. Bodhi, NDB, n.713"]
____
Here, having been born into the world, he dwells having entirely removed the
covering in the world (_loke tam chadanam vivattetva_), in the darkness of
defilements covered by seven coverings (_chadanehi_): lust, hatred, delusion,
conceit, views, ignorance, and misconduct.

_Arahaṃ hoti sammāsambuddho loke vivaṭṭacchadoti ettha
rāga-dosa-moha-māna-diṭṭhi-avijjā-duccaritachadanehi sattahi
paṭicchanne kilesandhakāre loke taṃ chadanaṃ vivaṭṭetvā samantato
sañjātāloko hutvā ṭhitoti vivaṭṭacchado._
____

But, although _taṇhā_ is called a covering (_taṇhāchadanachāditā_,
Ud.76), these seven factors are not. And although _avijjā_ comes close by
being called an eggshell, it is 'broken through' not 'removed.'

[quote, "A.4.176, Vin.3.3"]
____
Amongst the manyfolk who are void of insight into reality, enveloped and
smothered [in uninsightfulness into reality], having broken through the
eggshell of uninsightfulness into reality (_avijjaṇḍakosaṃ padāletvā_),
I alone in the world have fully awakened to unsurpassed, complete enlightenment.

_Evameva kho ahaṃ brāhmaṇa avijjāgatāya pajāya aṇḍabhūtāya
pariyonaddhāya avijjaṇḍakosaṃ padāletvā eko'va loke anuttaraṃ
sammāsambodhiṃ abhisambuddho._
____

Nonetheless, Bodhi accepts the commentary's explanation, and translates
_vivaṭṭacchadda_ as 'those who have removed the coverings,' and explains
his decision as follows:

- Though various conjectures might be proposed with respect to the original
expression and its meaning, given the difficulty of settling these questions
across Buddhist textual traditions, the most expedient course open to me is to
translate the term as it has been preserved and interpreted in the Pāli
tradition (NDB n.713).

'Remove the coverings' would certainly fit the context, but to avoid its absurd
connotations it would be better parenthesised to: 'remove the coverings [of
lust, hatred, delusion, conceit, views, ignorance, and misconduct],' or, more
justifiably, 'remove the covering [of _avijjā_].'

===== 'With deceit removed': unfitting

Norman uses the spelling _vivattacchadda_ and calls it 'with deceit removed,'
because in Sanskrit, according to Monier Williams, _chadman_ has the meaning
'deceit, disguise.' But this rendering does not fit the contexts.

===== Our interpretation

_Vivaṭṭacchaddo_ is primarily found in poetry, and we regard _vi_- as an
unwarranted prefix, but in accordance with Warder's comments, who says:

- The verses of the Dīgha Nikāya illustrate their most important linguistic
and metrical characteristics. The linguistic features to remark are twofold:
poetic licence and the use of archaic forms obsolete in everyday speech...
Poetic licence is most noticeable in the freedom of word order in verse. Since
the inflections generally show the relations between words in a sentence,
almost any deviation from the prose order is possible without serious change of
meaning... A prefix may be dropped or added where the meaning of the sentence
will tolerate a slight change of nuance (Warder, Introduction to Pāli p.354-5).

Because prefixes are subject to poetic licence, we therefore regard
_vivaṭṭacchaddo_ as standing for _vaṭṭa chaḍḍo_, with _vi_- for
emphasis. Comments in the PED show that we are not the first to explain
_chadda_ as _chaḍḍa_: the commentaries have done likewise. But the real
strength of our argument lies in the fittingness of our rendering, which we
parade in the Illustrations below.

===== Meaning of chaḍḍeti

_Chaḍḍeti_ means 'throw' or 'pour,' and _vicchaḍḍeti_ means 'scatter
about':

[quote, M.2.138]
____
He discards the bowl water neither too far nor too close, and he does not
scatter it about.

_So pattodakaṃ chaḍḍeti nātidūre nāccāsanne na ca
vicchaḍḍayamāno._
____

In later Pāli, _vicchaḍḍeti_ meant to throw out, to vomit, says PED.

===== Chinnaṃ vaṭṭaṃ

If _vivaṭṭacchadda_ means 'completely renounced the round of rebirth,' then
it is comparable to _chinnaṃ vaṭṭaṃ_, 'the round of rebirth destroyed'
in this passage:

[quote, Ud.75]
____
He has destroyed the round of rebirth, abandoned longing. The dried-up stream
no longer flows. The round of rebirth, destroyed, no longer continues. This is
truly the end of suffering.

_Acchecchi vaṭṭaṃ byagā nirāsaṃ vusukkhā saritā na sandati.
Chinnaṃ vaṭṭaṃ na vattati esevanto dukkhassā ti._

phenomena] [according to reality]: he would properly fulfil the ideals of
religious asceticism in the world.

=== Viveka

==== Renderings

- _viveka_: seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome
factors]

- _viveka_: physical seclusion (= _paviveka_, metri causa)

==== Introduction

===== Parenthesis: seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors]

_Viveka_ usually has no designated object. Our parenthesis comes from this
quote:

[quote, M.1.301]
____
Secluded from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors, a bhikkhu
enters and abides in first jhāna, which is accompanied by thinking and
pondering, and rapture and physical pleasure born of seclusion [from sensuous
pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors].

_Idhāvuso visākha bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi dhammehi
savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ
upasampajja viharati._
____

Because _vivekajaṃ_ corresponds to _vivicceva kāmehi vivicca akusalehi
dhammehi_, therefore _viveka_ = seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and
spiritually unwholesome factors].

===== Viveka = vavakaṭṭha & nekkhamma

Our renderings for _vavakaṭṭha_ and _nekkhamma_ are:

- _Vavakaṭṭha_: 'withdrawn [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually
unwholesome factors].' See Glossary sv _Vavakaṭṭha_.

- _Nekkhamma_: 'the practice of unsensuousness.' See Glossary sv _Nekkhamma_.

In the following quote _vivekaninnaṃ cittaṃ hoti_ equals
_vavakaṭṭhaṃ_ plus _nekkhammābhirataṃ_:

[quote, A.4.224]
____
His mind inclines, verges, and drifts towards seclusion [from sensuous
pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors]. It is withdrawn [from sensuous
pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors], taking delight in the practice
of unsensuousness.

_vivekaninnaṃ cittaṃ hoti vivekapoṇaṃ vivekapabbhāraṃ
vavakaṭṭhaṃ nekkhammābhirataṃ._
____

Therefore, again, _viveka_ = 'seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and
spiritually unwholesome factors].'

===== Viveka means physical seclusion, metri causa

_Paviveka_ not _viveka_ means physical seclusion. Only in verse does _viveka_
mean physical seclusion, metri causa. See Glossary sv _Paviveka_.

_Rūpesu vihaññamāne_: 'troubled by [attachment to] bodily forms.' The
locative shows the cause, reason, or motive of an action (PGPL, para601). The
parenthesis 'attachment' is justified by the advice to 'abandon' (_jahassu_) in
pāda d. The principle is repeated with _upādāya_ in verse 169:

=== Veda; Vedagū

==== Renderings

- _veda_: scriptural collection

- _veda_: Buddhist scriptural collection

- _veda_: scriptural knowledge

- _veda_: Vedic scriptural knowledge

- _tiṇṇaṃ vedānaṃ_: the three Vedas

- _vedagū_: blessed with profound knowledge

- _vedagū_: knowledgeable

- _vedasampanno_: endowed with profound knowledge

- _vedasampanno_: perfect in Vedic scriptural knowledge

- _vedantagū_: one who has completed his scriptural education

==== Introduction

===== Veda

_Veda_ means:

1. singular: knowledge or scriptural knowledge

2. plural: the three Vedas (_tiṇṇaṃ vedānaṃ_)

===== The three Vedas: three canonical collections

PED calls the Vedas singular 'canon.'

- the 'brahmanic canon of authorised religious teaching.'

Webster's dictionary calls them plural 'collections':

- the 'canonical collections of hymns, prayers and liturgical formulas that
comprise the earliest Hindu writings.'

The three Vedas are:

- The Rig-Veda: the canonical collection of laudatory stanzas in praise of
devas.

- The Sama-Veda: the canonical collection of chants for the Soma sacrifice.

- The Yajur-Veda: the canonical collection of chants for sacrificial rites.

===== Veda: scriptural collections of any religion

We will not call religious scriptures 'canon,' which only applies to authorised
collections. And although Webster's calls the Vedas 'writings,' texts were not
originally written. So we will call them: 'scriptural collections.'

Although PED says _veda_ stands for 'the three Vedas' (_tiṇṇaṃ
vedānaṃ_), _veda_ means sacred literature of any religion, and _vedehi_ at
Sn.v.792 stands specifically for 'the Buddhist scriptural collections.'

===== Vedasampanno and vedagū: the Buddhists

_Veda_ was used by the Buddhists to mean profound knowledge, notably in two
words:

1. _vedasampanno_, 'endowed with profound knowledge'

2. _vedagū_, 'blessed with profound knowledge'

===== Vedagū defined in terms of yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti

_Vedagū_ is defined in terms of _yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti_ as follows:

[quote, S.4.83]
____
In what way is a bhikkhu blessed with profound knowledge?

_Kathañca bhikkhave bhikkhu vedagū hoti_

(...) When he discerns according to reality the origination, vanishing,
sweetness, wretchedness, and deliverance in regards to the six senses

_Yato kho bhikkhave bhikkhu channaṃ phassāyatanānaṃ samudayañca
atthaṅgamañca assādañca ādīnavañca nissaraṇañca yathābhūtaṃ
pajānāti_

(...) In this way a bhikkhu is blessed with profound knowledge

_evaṃ kho bhikkhave bhikkhu vedagū hoti._
____

===== Vedagū defined in terms of vidita

_Vedagū_ is defined in terms of _vidita_ as follows:

[quote, M.1.280]
____
In what way is a bhikkhu blessed with profound knowledge?

_Kathañca bhikkhave bhikkhu vedagū hoti?_

(...) Unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors that are defiling, and which
lead to renewed states of individual existence, suffering, unpleasant karmic
consequences, and future birth, old age, and death are completely understood by
him.

_Viditāssa honti pāpakā akusalā dhammā saṅkilesikā ponobbhavikā
sadarā dukkhavipākā āyatiṃ jātijarāmaraṇiyā._

(...) In this way a bhikkhu is blessed with profound knowledge.

_Evaṃ kho bhikkhave bhikkhu vedagū hoti._
____

===== Vidita: 'completely understood'

_Vidita_ is the past participle of _vindati_, meaning 'known, found (out),'
says PED. Yet in the passage above we translated it as 'completely understood.'
Rendering it with this stronger meaning is justified because in that passage
_vindati_ was used in a play of words to explain _vedagū_, which can be proved
by considering other passages, where stronger verbs are elsewhere linked to
_vedagū_:

1. _Vedagū_ was defined in terms of _yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti_ in a quote
above.

2. _Vedagū_ is associated with 'having understood things through and through'
(_parovarā samecca dhammā_) in this quote:

[quote, A.2.6]
____
One for whom, having understood things through and through they are destroyed,
they have vanished, they do not exist: he is blessed with profound knowledge.
He has fulfilled the religious life.

_Parovarā yassa samecca dhammā vidhūpitā atthaṅgatā na santi +
Sa vedagū vusitabrahmacariyo._
____

_Samecca_ is absolutive of _sameti_: 'having acquired or learnt, knowing,' says
PED.

===== Vedasampanno and vedagū: the brahmans and others

For brahmans these words meant:

1. _vedasampanno_: 'perfect in Vedic scriptural knowledge.'

2. _vedagū_: 'knowledgeable,' a synonym of _dhīro._

[quote, Sn.v.890]
____
But if, by one's own reckoning, one were knowledgeable and wise, then none
among ascetics would be a fool.

_Atha ce sayaṃ vedagū hoti dhīro na koci bālo samaṇesu atthi._
____

===== Vedantagū: completed one's scriptural education

_Vedantagū_ means 'reached the end of scriptural knowledge,' but reads better
as 'completed one's scriptural education,' as here:

[quote, Sn.v.463]
____
One who has submitted to inward taming, completed his scriptural education,
fulfilled the religious life.

_damasā upeto vedantagū vusitabrahmacariyo._

=== Vedanā; Vedayita

==== Renderings

- _vedanā_: sense impression

- _vedanā_: feelings

- _vedanā_: pains

- _vedayita_: experienced

- _vedayita_: sense impression

==== Introduction

===== Vedayita = vedanā

_Vedayita_ is the past participle of _vedeti_, meaning 'felt, experienced,'
says PED. In some circumstances, we accordingly call it 'experienced.' But it
is otherwise to be treated as a synonym of _vedanā_, for which we provide the
following evidence:

1. Bodhi treats them as synonyms. For example he calls _vedayita_ 'feeling' at
S.4.144 and A.4.409.

2. The suttas likewise treat them as synonyms, for example in these two quotes:
+
[quote, A.4.409]
____
For one who has attained the ending of perception and sense impression,
perception and sense impression are ended.

_Saññāvedayitaṃ nirodhaṃ samāpannassa saññā ca vedanā ca niruddhā
honti._
____
+
[quote, D.2.67]
____
'If there were no sense impression in any way, would there be the thought "I am
this"?' 'No, bhante.' 'Therefore this argument is invalid: Sense impression is
not my [absolute] Selfhood. My [absolute] Selfhood is without sense impression.'

_yattha panāvuso sabbaso vedayitaṃ natthi api nu kho tattha ayamahamasmī ti
siyā ti. No hetaṃ bhante. Tasmātihānanda etenapetaṃ nakkhamati na heva
kho me vedanā attā appaṭisaṃvedano me attā ti samanupassituṃ._
____

3. Both _vedayita_ and _vedanā_ have the same threefold division:
+
[quote, S.4.144]
____
Whatever sense impression that arises due to visual sensation -- whether
pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral -- becomes manifest to him according to
reality, as unlasting.

_yampidaṃ cakkhusamphassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ sukhaṃ vā
dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā tampi aniccanti yathābhūtaṃ okkhāyati._
____
+
[quote, M.1.266]
____
Whatever sense impression he experiences, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral,
he takes delight in that sense impression, he welcomes it, and persists in
cleaving to it. In so doing, spiritually fettering delight arises.

_yaṃ kiñci vedanaṃ vedeti sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā
so taṃ vedanaṃ abhinandati abhivadati ajjhosāya tiṭṭhati tassa taṃ
vedanaṃ abhinandato abhivadato ajjhosāya tiṭṭhato uppajjati nandī._
____

===== Vedanā and Phassa

The relationship between _vedanā_ ('sense impression') and _phassa_
('sensation') is as follows:

[quote, S.2.74]
____
Dependent on the visual sense and visible objects, advertence to the visual
field arises. The association of the three is sensation. Sense impression
arises dependent on sensation.

_Cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṃ. Tiṇṇaṃ
saṅgati phasso. Phassapaccayā vedanā.._

Experiencing a pleasant sense impression, he knows that it is unlasting; he
knows that it is not cleaved to; he knows that it is not delighted in.

_So sukhaṃ ce vedanaṃ vedeti. Sā aniccā ti pajānāti anajjhositā ti

Experiencing an unpleasant sense impression, he knows that it is unlasting;
he knows that it is not cleaved to; he knows that it is not delighted in.

_Dukkhaṃ ce vedanaṃ vedeti. Sā aniccā ti pajānāti. Anajjhositā ti

[quote, S.4.208]
____
Bhikkhus, when the ignorant Everyman is affected by an unpleasant sense
impression, he grieves, suffers, and laments, weeps beating his chest, and
falls into bewilderment.

_assutavā puthujjano dukkhāya vedanāya phuṭṭho samāno socati kilamati
paridevati urattāḷiṃ kandati sammohaṃ āpajjati_

He experiences two sense impressions—a bodily one and a psychological one.

_so dve vedanā vediyati kāyikañca cetasikañca._

Being affected by that unpleasant sense impression, he has feelings of
repugnance for it.

_Tassāyeva kho pana dukkhāya vedanāya phuṭṭho samāno paṭighavā hoti._

When he has feelings of repugnance for unpleasant sense impression, the
proclivity to repugnance towards unpleasant sense impression lurks within him.

_Tamenaṃ dukkhāya vedanāya paṭighavantaṃ yo dukkhāya vedanāya
paṭighānusayo so anuseti_

When affected by an unpleasant sense impression, he longs for sensuous
pleasure. For what reason?

_so dukkhāya vedanāya phuṭṭho samāno kāmasukhaṃ abhinandati. Taṃ
kissa hetu_

Because the ignorant Everyman does not discern any deliverance from unpleasant
sense impression other than through sensuous pleasure.

_na bhikkhave pajānāti assutavā puthujjano aññatra kāmasukhā dukkhāya

unlasting, originated, dependently arisen, how could it be lasting?'

Prince Dīghāvu, to Brahmādatta, the King of Kāsi, who executed Dīghāvu's father:

[quote, Vin.1.348]
____
Concerning that, Your Majesty, which my father said to me at the time of his
death:

"not far" means: Do not sustain unfriendliness long.

_mā dīghan ti mā ciraṃ veraṃ akāsī ti_

"not close" means: Do not hastily break with a friend.

_mā rassan ti mā khippaṃ mittehi bhijjitthā ti_

"Unfriendly deeds are not stopped by unfriendliness. Unfriendly deeds, dear
Dīghāvu, are stopped by friendliness" means:

_na hi tāta Dīghāvu verena verā sammanti. Averena hi tāta dīghāvu verā
sammantī ti_

My parents were killed by a king. But if I were to deprive the king of life
those who desired the king's well-being would deprive me of life and those who
desired my well-being would deprive these of life. Thus that unfriendly deed
would not be settled by unfriendliness.

_devena me mātāpitaro hatā ti sacāhaṃ devaṃ jīvitāvoropeyyaṃ ye
devassa atthakāmā te maṃ jīvitā voropeyyuṃ. Ye me atthakāmā te te

But now that life is granted me by a king, and life is granted a king by me,
thus is that unfriendly deed settled by friendliness.

=== Vossagga

==== Renderings

- _vossagga_: relinquishment [of attachment]

- _vossagga_: granting leave

- _vossagga_: delegation

- _vossajjati_: to relinquish [attachment]

- _vossajjati_: to relinquish

==== Introduction

===== The meaning of vossaggapariṇāmiṃ

In the formula of the seven factors of enlightenment, _vossaggapariṇāmiṃ_
('results in relinquishment') is said to be the result of that practice:

____
In this regard a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness which
conduces to seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome
factors], to non-attachment [to originated phenomena], to the ending [of
originated phenomena], and which results in _vossagga.'_

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu satisambojjhaṅgaṃ bhāveti vivekanissitaṃ
virāganissitaṃ nirodhanissitaṃ vossaggapariṇāmiṃ._
____

But the goal of the seven factors of enlightenment is also said to be 1)
_bodha_ 2) _taṇhakkhaya,_ and 3) _vijjāvimutti_, all of which imply
_nibbāna_:

1. They lead to enlightenment, therefore they are called factors of
enlightenment
+
****
_Bodhāya saṃvattantīti kho bhikkhu tasmā bojjhaṅgāti vuccanti_ (S.5.83).
****

2. And what is the path and practice leading to the destruction of craving? It
is the seven factors of enlightenment.
+
****
_Katamo ca bhikkhave maggo katamā ca paṭipadā taṇhakkhayāya
saṃvattati: yadidaṃ satta bojjhaṅgā_ (S.5.86).
****

3. The seven factors of enlightenment, when developed and cultivated, bring to
perfection insightfulness into reality and liberation [from perceptually
obscuring states].
+
****
_satta bojjhaṅgā bhāvitā bahulīkatā vijjāvimuttiṃ paripūrenti_
(S.5.329).
****

Because _bodha_, _taṇhakkhaya_ and _vijjāvimutti_ imply _nibbāna_ it would
be congruous if _vossagga_ was understood in the same way. How, then, should it
be rendered? Let us consider its synonyms, _cāgo_ and _paṭinissaggo_, which
are likewise equivalent to _nibbāna_ in the following sense:

[quote, M.3.245]
____
For this, bhikkhu, is the supreme noble relinquishment, namely the
relinquishment of the whole phenomenon of attachment.

_Eso hi bhikkhu paramo ariyo cāgo yadidaṃ sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo._
____

That _sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo_ is a synonym of _nibbāna_ is demonstrated
here:

[quote, Vin.1.5]
____
This is indeed a matter difficult to realise, namely the quelling of all
originated phenomena, the relinquishment of the whole phenomenon of
attachment... the Untroubled.

_Idampi kho ṭhānaṃ duddasaṃ yadidaṃ sabbasaṅkhārasamatho
sabbūpadhipaṭinissaggo taṇhakkhayo virāgo nirodho nibbānaṃ._
____

Thus, to be equivalent to _bodha_, _taṇhakkhaya_ and _vijjāvimutti_,
_vossaggapariṇāmiṃ_ should be rendered as 'results in the relinquishment
[of the whole phenomenon of attachment].'

===== Vossagga in other contexts

Having established that the object of _vossagga_ is _upadhi_, we take this as
its object elsewhere where an object is needed, most importantly in the phrase:

[quote, S.5.197]
____

=== Vyāpajjha; Vyābajjhā

==== Renderings

- _vyāpajjha_: hostility

- _vyābajjha_: affliction

==== Introduction

===== Considerable confusion: BJT editor astonished

That _vyāpajjha_ and _vyābajjha_ are hopelessly confused is expressed in the
digital edition of the Sri Lanka Buddha Jayanti Tripiṭaka, where the editor
comments on this quote:

____
Properly reflecting, he uses therapeutic requisites simply to ward off
troublesome feelings that have arisen and for maximum freedom from affliction.

_Paṭisaṅkhā yoniso gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāraṃ paṭisevati
yāvadeva uppannānaṃ veyyābādhikānaṃ vedanānaṃ paṭighātāya
avyābajjhaparamatāya._
____

However, at M.1.10 an alternative spelling occurs: _avyāpajjhaparamatāya,_
about which the BJT editor has this to say:

- We correct the 'p' in _avyāpajjha_ of the BJT text to 'b' in agreement with
the PTS M1 and Nld readings. We regard _avyābajjha_ as the correct reading
because it is derived from the basic Pāli word _vyābādha vyābādhya
vyābajjha_. In view of this process of derivation, we opt the final reading to
be _avyābajjha_. At the same time it is astonishing to find the derivative
from the Pāli word _vyāpāda_ written as _vyāpajjha_. The two words appear
to be the result of a considerable amount of mutual confusion.

===== Bodhi: similar correction

A vacillation between _savyābajjhā_ and _savyāpajjhā_ is seen in a passage
at M.2.130, which in 2001 Bhikkhu Bodhi translated as follows:

[quote, M.2.130]
____
Great king, those gods who are still subject to affliction come back to this
[human] state, those gods who are no longer subject to affliction do not come
back to this [human] state (Bodhi, 2001)

_Ye te mahārāja devā savyābajjhā te devā āgantāro itthattaṃ ye te
devā avyābajjhā te devā anāgantāro itthattan ti._
____

But in 2005, he adopted the alternative Pāli, and translated as follows:

[quote, M.2.130]
____
Great king, those gods who are still subject to ill will come back to this
[human] state, those gods who are no longer subject to ill will do not come
back to this [human] state (Bodhi, 2005).

_Ye te mahārāja devā savyāpajjhā te devā āgantāro itthattaṃ ye te
devā avyāpajjhā te devā anāgantāro itthattan ti._
____

Although either reading could be justified, the 2001 edition is preferable for
two reasons:

1. Non-returners do not usually proclaim themselves in terms of freedom from
ill will. More usually they proclaim themselves in terms of freedom from
sensuous hankering:
+
[quote, D.2.51]
____
We, dear sir, who lived the religious life under the Blessed One Vipassī have
been reborn here having discarded sensuous hankering for sensuous pleasures.

_Te mayaṃ mārisa vipassimhi bhagavatī brahmacariyaṃ caritvā kāmesu
kāmacchandaṃ virājetvā idhūpapannā ti._
____

2. It is in accordance with other suttas to define non-returnership in terms of
non-affliction because non-returners have demolished all demerit in their
lifetime, and therefore the associated affliction to be experienced:

[quote, A.5.300]
____
Whatever demeritorious karmically consequential conduct was previously
undertaken by this [wretched human] body born of deeds, all [the consequences
of] that must be experienced now [in this lifetime]; it will not [be able to]
arise hereafter.' Thus developed, the liberation [from perceptually obscuring
states] through [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill leads to
non-returnership for a wise bhikkhu here who has not penetrated to a more
exalted liberation.

_yaṃ kho me idha kiñcī pubbe iminā karajakāyena pāpakammaṃ kataṃ
sabbaṃ taṃ idha vedanīyaṃ na taṃ anugaṃ bhavissatī ti. Evaṃ
bhāvitā kho bhikkhave mettācetovimutti anāgāmitāya saṃvattati idha
paññassa bhikkhuno uttariṃ vimuttiṃ appaṭivijjhato._
____

===== Confusion noted in PED

The source of the confusion between the spellings can be seen in PED's comments:

1. Vyābādha (& byābādha) [fr. vi+ā+bādh, but semantically connected with
vi+ā+pad, as in vyāpāda & vyāpajjha

2. Avyāpajjha1 (abyābajjha) (nt.) [a + vyapajjha or bajjha, a confusion
between the roots bādh or pad]

3. Avyāpajjha2 (abyābajjha) adj.) [either a + vyāpadya or more likely a +
vyābādhya]

===== Resolving the confusion

We resolve the confusion as follows:

1. All _bya_- prefixes are spelt here as _vya_-

2. We spell _vyāpajjha_ with 'h.' We regard _vyāpajja_ as a misspelling. PED
likewise does not recognise this as a word.

3. _Vyāpajjha_ ('hostility') is commonly associated with _veraṃ_
('unfriendliness'), implying that the words are synonyms. In the context of
_veraṃ_ we therefore regard _vyābajjhā_ ('affliction') as a misspelling,
and correct it to _vyāpajjhā_. For example, consider this passage:

[quote, A.4.246]
____
To limitless beings he gives freedom from fear, unfriendliness, and hostility.

_aparimāṇānaṃ sattānaṃ abhayaṃ deti. Averaṃ deti. Avyāpajjhaṃ
deti._

(...) In doing so, he partakes of limitless freedom from fear, unfriendliness,
and hostility.

_Aparimāṇānaṃ sattānaṃ abhayaṃ datvā averaṃ datvā avyāpajjhaṃ
datvā aparimāṇassa abhayassa averassa avyāpajjhassa bhāgī hoti._
____

A misspelt variant reading is given in VRI, as follows:

- _Aparimāṇānaṃ sattānaṃ abhayaṃ datvā averaṃ datvā
avyābajjhaṃ datvā aparimāṇassa abhayassa averassa avyābajjhassa bhāgī
hoti._

==== Introduction

===== Saṃyutta and yutta

_Saṃyutta_ (pp. of _saṃyuñjati_) and _yutta_ (pp. of _yuñjati_) sometimes
occur together in passages, and are then synonyms meaning 'tethered [to
individual existence].' For example:

[quote, It.50]
____
Beings who are tethered [to individual existence] by the tie of craving, whose
minds are attached to various states of individual existence, are tethered [to
individual existence] by Māra's tie.

_Taṇhāyogena saṃyuttā rattacittā bhavābhave te yogayuttā mārassa._
____

_Yutta_ has other meanings, too. For example:

[quote, Sn.v.820]
____
Devoted: He is devoted to sexual intercourse.

_methune yutto._
____

[quote, S.4.176]
____
Harnessed: A chariot harnessed to thoroughbreds

_ājaññaratho yutto._
____

===== Saṃyutta and visaṃyutta: parenthesis

Where _saṃyutta_ and _visaṃyutta_ have no object we parenthesise, calling
them:

- _saṃyutta_: tethered [to individual existence]

- _visaṃyutta_: emancipated [from individual existence]

This is justified because of the close relationship between _saṃyutta_ and
_saṃyojana_. That _saṃyojana_ means _bhavapaṭilābhiyāni
saṃyojanāni_, we discuss sv _Saṃyojana_.

It is also justified by clues given in many quotes. Consider four examples:

1. Tethered [to individual existence] by the bond of dogmatism, the ignorant
Everyman is not freed from birth, old age, and death, from grief, lamentation,
physical pain, psychological pain, and vexation.

****
_diṭṭhisaṃyojanasaṃyutto bhikkhave assutavā puthujjano na parimuccati
jātiyā jarāmaraṇena sokehi paridevehi dukkhehi domanassehi upāyāsehi_
(M.1.8).
****

2. Beings who are tethered [to individual existence] by the tie of craving,
whose minds are attached to renewed states of individual existence, are
tethered [to individual existence] by Māra's tie. They have not reached safety
from the danger of bondage [to individual existence]. [Such] beings follow the
round of birth and death, and go to rebirth and death.

****
Te yogayuttā mārassa ayogakkhemino janā +

3. Tethered [to individual existence] by the bondage [to individual existence]
that arises from [attachment to] both sensuous pleasure and individual
existence, tethered [to individual existence] by the bondage [to individual
existence] that arises from dogmatism, led on by uninsightfulness into reality,
[such] beings follow the round of birth and death, and go to rebirth and death.

4. He who, having abandoned the bondage to renewed states of human existence,
has transcended the bondage to renewed states of divine existence, he is
emancipated from all bondage [to individual existence]. He is what I call a
Brahman.

==== Introduction

===== Saṃyoga metri causa for bandhana

Sometimes _saṃyoga_ stands _metri causa_ for _bandhana_. For example:

[quote, Sn.v.733]
____
Having overcome Māra's bond [that binds one to renewed states of individual
existence], they do not come to renewed states of individual existence.

_Abhibhuyya mārasaṃyogaṃ nāgacchanti punabbhavan ti._
____

Only here is Māra's bond called _mārasaṃyoga_. Usually (23 times) it is
called _mārabandhana_ (Māra's bond [that binds one to renewed states of
individual existence], S.1.24; S.4.92; S.4.202). So _mārasaṃyoga_ stands
_metri causa_ for _mārabandhana_.

===== Saṃyoga metri causa for saṃyojana

_Saṃyoga_'s relationship to _saṃyojana_ is that of 'bondage' (_saṃyogo,_
uncountable) to 'bond' (_saṃyojana,_ countable):

[quote, S.4.36]
____
Where there is attachment, there is bondage [to individual existence]. Tethered
[to individual existence] by the bond of spiritually fettering delight,
Migajāla, a bhikkhu is called 'one living with a partner.'

_sārāge sati saṃyogo hoti nandisaṃyojanasaṃyutto kho migajāla bhikkhu
sadutiyavihārī ti vuccati._
____

A countable noun is called for in the following quote, and _saṃyoga_
therefore stands for _saṃyojana._

[quote, S.3.143]
____
He should abandon all ties to individual existence.

_Pajahe sabbasaṃyogaṃ._
____

The commentary agrees: _sabbaṃ dasavidhampi saṃyojanaṃ_.

===== Parenthesising saṃyoga and visaṃyoga

Where _saṃyoga_ and _visaṃyoga_ lack an object, we parenthesise, calling
them:

- _saṃyoga_: bondage [to individual existence]

- _visaṃyoga_: emancipation [from individual existence]

This is justified for two reasons:

1. by _saṃyoga_'s relationship to _saṃyutto_ which we parenthesise likewise
(and explain sv _Saṃyutta_)_,_ as seen in the following quote. See Glossary
sv _Saṃyutta_:
+
[quote, S.4.36]
____
When there is spiritually fettering delight, there is attachment. Where there
is attachment, there is bondage [to individual existence]. Tethered [to

_Sabbasaṃyoge_ is metri causa for _sabbasaṃyojane_. The commentary agrees:

==== Introduction

===== On not parenthesising

_Saṃyojanāni_ is shown in the following quote to be an abbreviation of
_bhavapaṭilābhiyāni saṃyojanāni_ ('ties to individual existence'). In
which case, _saṃyojana_ could be parenthesised: 'tie [to individual
existence].' However, that _saṃyojana_ means 'tie to individual existence' is
so well established in the suttas, that parenthesis seems unnecessary. After
all, in the same following quote _orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni_ is used,
where, according to the same quote, it should read _orambhāgiyāni
bhavapaṭilābhiyāni saṃyojanāni_.

[quote, A.2.134]
____
[In the arahant] the ties to individual existence in the low plane of existence

==== Introduction

===== Indriyasaṃvara: animals sitting beside a post

_Indriyasaṃvara_ means 'restraint of the sense faculties [from attraction and
repulsion, through mindfulness].' The parenthesis says the restraint operates
via mindfulness. Without the parenthesis, 'restraint' tends to suggest the
application of force: 'restraint of the sense faculties'. But the
_Chappāṇaka Sutta_ shows that with _indriyasaṃvara_ there is no force at
all. It is like training of wild animals by tying them to a post (S.4.200).
Although the animals initially struggle to escape, eventually, worn out and
fatigued, they sit or curl up beside the post. At this point, the animals are
not 'restrained [by force].'

===== Indriyasaṃvara: body and mind are steady

The _Kuṇḍaliya Sutta_ (S.5.74) describes how restraint of the sense
faculties [from attraction and repulsion, through mindfulness] should be
developed (_indriyasaṃvaro kathaṃ bahulīkato_). It says that in this
practice, 'his body is steady and his mind is steady, inwardly settled and
[temporarily] liberated [from perceptually obscuring states].' These adjectives
show that _saṃvaro_ is not a matter of force:

[quote, S.5.74]
____
And how, Kuṇḍaliya, is restraint of the sense faculties [from attraction
and repulsion, through mindfulness] developed and cultivated so that it brings
to perfection the three kinds of good conduct? In this regard, Kuṇḍaliya,
seeing a pleasing visible object via the visual sense, a bhikkhu does not long
for it or get excited by it or become attached to it. His body is steady and
his mind is steady, inwardly settled and [temporarily] liberated [from
perceptually obscuring states].

In seeing a displeasing visible object via the visual sense, he is not
disconcerted by it, not daunted, not dejected, free of ill will. His body is
steady and his mind is steady, inwardly settled and [temporarily] liberated

===== Indriyasaṃvara: restraint [through mindfulness]

_Indriyasaṃvara_ is developed by practising mindfulness, as these quotes show:

1. When a bhikkhu has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, the eye
does not incline towards pleasing visible objects nor are displeasing visible
objects loathsome... In this way there is restraint [of the sense faculties]
[from attraction and repulsion, through mindfulness].
+
****
_kāyagatā sati bhāvitā bahulīkatā cakkhu nāviñjati manāpikesu rūpesu
amanāpikassa rūpāni nappaṭikkūlā honti... evaṃ kho bhikkhave saṃvaro
hoti_ (S.4.200).

===== Indriyasaṃvara means no delight in sense objects

When the senses are mastered the bhikkhu takes no delight in sense objects:

[quote, S.4.78-80]
____
In what way is there restraint [of the sense faculties] [from attraction
and repulsion, through mindfulness]?

_Kathañca bhikkhave saṃvaro hoti?_

(...) There are visible objects known via the visual sense that are likeable,
loveable, pleasing, agreeable, connected with sensuous pleasure, and charming.

_Santi bhikkhave cakkhuviññeyyā rūpā iṭṭhā kantā manāpā piyarūpā
kāmupasaṃhitā rajanīyā._

(...) If a bhikkhu does not take delight in them, welcome them, persist in
cleaving to them, he should understand this thus: 'I am not falling away from
spiritually wholesome factors. For this has been called not falling away by the
Blessed One.

_Tañce bhikkhu nābhinandati nābhivadati nājjhosāya tiṭṭhati.
Veditabbametaṃ bhikkhave bhikkhunā na parihāyāmi kusalehi dhammehi

(...) In this way there is restraint [of the sense faculties] [from attraction
and repulsion, through mindfulness]

_Evaṃ kho bhikkhave saṃvaro hotī ti._
____

===== Unrestrained sense faculties equals grasping

Unrestrained sense faculties equal grasping, and this leads to greed and
dejection:

[quote, S.4.178]
____
In seeing a visible object via the visual sense, do not grasp its aspects and
features. Since by abiding with the faculty of sight unrestrained [from
attraction and repulsion, through mindfulness], greed, dejection, and
unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors would pursue you.

_Cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā mā nimittaggāhino ahuvattha mānuvyañjanaggāhino

===== Saṃvara as an abbreviation for indriyasaṃvara

When _saṃvara_ is used as an abbreviation for _indriyasaṃvara_ we
parenthesise it as such: 'restraint [of the sense faculties] [from attraction
and repulsion, through mindfulness].'

===== Saṃvuto: [bodily] restrained

Sometimes _saṃvuto_ means '[bodily] restrained':

[quote, Sn.v.413]
____
Going on uninterrupted house-to-house almsround, with sense portals guarded [by
mindfulness], and [bodily] well-restrained;

_Sapadānaṃ caramāno guttadvāro susaṃvuto._
____

The parenthesis derives from this rule:

[quote, Vin.4.186]
____
In the village you should walk [bodily] well-restrained. If, disrespectful [of
the rule], one walks in the village playing with one's hands or feet it is a
dukkaṭa offence.

_Susaṃvutena antaraghare gantabbaṃ yo anādariyaṃ paṭicca hatthaṃ vā
pādaṃ vā kīḷapento antaraghare gacchati āpatti dukkaṭassa._
____

===== The constraints of the rules of discipline: pātimokkhasaṃvara

We call _pātimokkhasaṃvara_ 'the constraints of the rules of discipline.'
This can be illustrated with the following quotes:

1. the bhikkhu who practises within the constraints of the rules of discipline
+
****
_bhikkhu pātimokkhasaṃvarāya paṭipanno hotī ti_ (D.2.279).
****

2. Abide restrained [in conduct] within the constraints of the rules of
discipline
+
****
_pātimokkhasaṃvarasaṃvutā viharāhi_ (M.3.2).
****

===== Sīlasaṃvuta: one who abides restrained in [conduct within the constraints of the] code of morality

Our parenthesis of _sīlasaṃvuta_ stems from our translation of
_pātimokkhasaṃvarasaṃvuta_, i.e., we treat it as if it were
_sīlasaṃvarasaṃvuta viharato_:

[quote, D.1.69]
____
When a bhikkhu is himself perfect in virtue he sees no danger anywhere due to
his abiding restrained in [conduct within the constraints of] the code of
morality.

not grasp its aspects and features.

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā na nimittaggāhī hoti

Since, by abiding with the faculty of sight unrestrained [from attraction and
repulsion, through mindfulness], greed, dejection, and unvirtuous, spiritually
unwholesome factors would pursue him.

_yatvādhikaraṇamenaṃ cakkhundriyaṃ asaṃvutaṃ viharantaṃ abhijjhā

He applies himself to the restraint of the faculty [from attraction and
repulsion, through mindfulness], he supervises the faculty of sight [with
mindfulness], he attains restraint of the faculty of sight [through
mindfulness].

Suppose a chariot harnessed to thoroughbreds was standing ready on even ground
at a crossroads, with a goad on hand. Then a proficient handler, a trainer of
horses to be tamed, would mount it and, taking the reins in his left hand and

whenever he wants.

Suppose a man caught six animals with different natural habitats, and tied each
of them with a strong cord: a snake, a crocodile, a bird, a dog, a jackal, and
a monkey. Then he bound them to a strong post or pillar. Those six animals
would each incline towards its own natural habitat.

- The snake would try to enter an anthill.

- The crocodile would try to enter the water.

- The bird would try to fly into the air.

- The dog would try to enter a village.

- The jackal would try to enter a charnel ground.

- The monkey would try to enter a forest.

When these six animals were worn out and fatigued, they would stand by that
post or pillar, or sit or lie down there.

So, too, when a bhikkhu has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body

_kāyagatā sati bhāvitā bahulīkatā_

visible objects loathsome

Then Venerable MahāMoggallāna performed such a feat of psychic power that
with his big toe he made the Vejayanta Palace shake and quake and tremble.

A certain bhikkhu was dwelling amongst the Kosalan people in a certain woodland
grove. When that bhikkhu had gone for his daytime abiding, he kept thinking
unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome thoughts associated with the household life.

_Tena kho pana samayena so bhikkhu divāvihāragato pāpake akusale vitakke
vitakketi gehanissite._

Then the deva inhabiting that woodland grove, being tenderly concerned for that
bhikkhu, desiring his spiritual well-being, desiring to stir up in him an
earnest attitude [to the practice] (_saṃvejetukāmā_), approached him and
addressed him in verses:

_Atha kho yā tasmiṃ vanasaṇḍe adhivatthā devatā tassa bhikkhuno
anukampikā atthakāmā taṃ bhikkhuṃ saṃvejetukāmā yena so bhikkhu
tenupasaṅkami. Upasaṅkamitvā taṃ bhikkhuṃ gāthāhi ajjhabhāsi:_

Desiring seclusion [from sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome
factors] you entered the woods,

_Vivekakāmosi vanaṃ paviṭṭho_

Yet your mind gushes outwardly.

_atha te mano niccharatī bahiddhā_

Eliminate, man, your fondness for people;

_Jano janasmiṃ vinayassu chandaṃ_

Then you'll be truly happy, free of attachment.

===== Objects of saṃsagga and saṃsaṭṭha

Sometimes the objects of _saṃsagga_ and _saṃsaṭṭha_ are 'householders
and ascetics':

[quote, A.3.117]
____
A bhikkhu consorts with householders and ascetics in an unsuitable way like a
layperson.

===== Objectless saṃsagga and saṃsaṭṭha

Sometimes the object is missing, and we parenthesise. For example:

[quote, Th.v.860]
____
Remaining aloof [from householders and ascetics alike], delighted with whatever
offerings enter his almsbowl, Bhaddiya, son of Godhā, meditates [happily],
perseveringly, and free of grasping.

_Asaṃsaṭṭho sātatiko uñchāpattāgate rato +
Jhāyati anupādāno putto godhāya bhaddiyo._
____

Here the object of _asaṃsaṭṭho_ is missing. But the first words of verses
Th.v.857-860 form a list, namely: _appiccho, santuṭṭho, pavivitto,
asaṃsaṭṭho_. This whole set of four words occurs in verse 581, where the
meaning of _asaṃsaṭṭho_ is made clear i.e. _gahaṭṭhehi anāgārehi
cūbhayaṃ_:

[quote, Th.v.581]
____
And a sage should abide with few needs, content [with what is paltry and easily
gotten], living secludedly, remaining aloof from householders and ascetics
alike.

_Appiccho ceva santuṭṭho pavivitto vase muni +
Asaṃsaṭṭho gahaṭṭhehi anāgārehi cūbhayaṃ._
____

On the basis of this, where there is no object, we parenthesise 'householders
and ascetics.'

=== Saṃsāra

==== Renderings

- _saṃsarati_: to wander the round of birth and death

- _saṃsāra_: the round of birth and death

- _saṃsāra_: a round of birth and death

- _saṃsāra_ (present participle of _saṃsarati_): wandering the round of
birth and death

==== Introduction

===== Jātimaraṇasaṃsāra

We take _saṃsāra_ and _jātisaṃsāra_ as abbreviations for
_jātimaraṇasaṃsāra_, which occurs just four times in the scriptures, and
for which we use the term 'the round of birth and death.'

Others' translations of _jātimaraṇasaṃsāra_ are:

- the journeying-on of [repeated] births and deaths (Norman, Sn.v.729).

- the journeying-on of birth and death (Norman, Sn.v.202; Th.v.202; Th.v.339).

- wandering on in [the round of] birth and death (Bodhi, A.4.228).

===== Saṃsarati's present participles

_Saṃsarati_ has two present participles, says PED, _saṃsaraṃ_ and
_saṃsaranto_: 'wandering the round of birth and death.' For example:

[quote, S.2.184-5]
____
Beings roaming and wandering the round of birth and death...

_sattā... sandhāvantā saṃsarantā._

Bodhi: 'Beings roaming and wandering on'
____

[quote, Th.v.258]
____
While wandering the round of birth and death I went to hell.

_saṃsaraṃ hi nirayaṃ agacchisaṃ._

Norman: 'While journeying-on'
____

[quote, Th.v.215-6]
____
Wandering the round of birth and death for a long time I transmigrated
through [various] states of existence.

_Saṃsaraṃ dīghamaddhānaṃ gatīsu parivattisaṃ._

Norman: 'Journeying-on for a long time.'
____

===== Saṃsaraṃ as a verb

_Saṃsaraṃ_ is also used as a verb: 'has wandered the round of birth and
death.'

[quote, A.2.10]
____
Man has wandered the round of birth and death for a long time.

_puriso dīghamaddhānaṃ saṃsaraṃ._

Bodhi: 'A person wanders during this long time.'
____

===== Round of rebirth, not cycle

_Saṃsāra_ is derived from _sarati_, which means 'to go, flow, move along,'
says PED. This suggests linearity not circularity. Hence we prefer not to call
it 'cycle of birth and death,' but 'round of birth and death,' meaning 'a route
or circuit habitually covered' (Webster's).

The same issue would be true of _vaṭṭaṃ_. Unfortunately PED does not
differentiate between 'round' and 'cycle' when it gives the meaning of
_vaṭṭa_ as 'the "round" of existences, cycle of transmigrations.' But
_vaṭṭa_ is linked to _vattati_ which means 'to move, go on, proceed; to
happen, take place, to be; to be in existence; to fare, to do' (PED). Thus
_vaṭṭaṃ,_ too, is rendered here as 'round' not 'cycle':

[quote, Ud.75]
____
He has destroyed the round of rebirth, abandoned longing. The dried-up stream
no longer flows. The round of rebirth, destroyed, no longer continues. This is
truly the end of suffering.

_Acchecchi vaṭṭaṃ byagā nirāsaṃ vusukkhā saritā na sandati.

There are certain ascetics and Brahmanists whose doctrine and dogmatic view is
this: 'Purification comes about by wandering the round of birth and death.'

_Santi kho pana sāriputta eke samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṃ vādino evaṃ

But it is not easy to find a round of birth and death in this long time where I
have not wandered, apart from the devas of the Pure Abodes.

_Na kho paneso sāriputta saṃsāro sulabharūpo yo mayā asaṃsaritapubbo

For if I had wandered the round of birth and death amongst the devas of the
Pure Abodes I could not have come back again to this [low] plane of existence

Such a one, by destroying the first three ties to individual existence, is
destined to seven more [human lifetimes] at most. For seven more [human
lifetimes] at most he roams and wanders the round of birth and death amongst
devas and men and then puts an end to suffering.

_So tiṇṇaṃ saṃyojanānaṃ parikkhayā sattakkhattuparamo hoti
sattakkhattuparamaṃ deve ca manusse ca sandhāvitvā saṃsaritvā
dukkhassantaṃ karoti._

or he is reborn amongst [human] families. Having roamed and wandered the round
of birth and death amongst two or three [human] families he puts an end to
suffering

_kolaṅkolo hoti dve vā tīṇi vā kulāni sandhāvitvā saṃsaritvā
dukkhassantaṃ karoti._
____

Comment:

The Buddha said if Venerable Ānanda did not attain arahantship in this
lifetime, he would be Lord of the Devas seven times, and the king of Jambudīpa
for seven times (A.1.228). Thus _sattakkhattuparamo_ means one who is destined
to seven more [human lifetimes] at most. Deva rebirths do not count.

A first point is not to be discerned of beings [obstructed by] uninsightfulness

=== Sakyaputtiya

==== Renderings

- _sakyaputta_ (for bhikkhus): young Sakyan bhikkhu

- _sakyaputta_ (for the Buddha): the Sakyans' Son

- _sakyaputtiya_: disciple of the Sakyans' Son

- _sakyadhītā_ (bhikkhunīs): [spiritual] daughter of the Sakyan

==== Introduction

===== Sakyaputto: Sakyan bhikkhus

_Sakyaputto_ is a term reserved for Sakyan bhikkhus. For example, Upanando
Sakyaputto, Hatthako Sakyaputto, and others.

Why were Sakyan bhikkhus called _putto_? Perhaps they were much younger than
other ascetics, especially in the early years of the Buddha's ministry. The
Buddha was so much younger than contemporary religious teachers that King
Pasenadi doubted he was enlightened at all (S.1.68). If so, then _sakyaputto_
does not mean 'son of the Sakyan clan' but 'young Sakyan bhikkhu.' This is in
accordance with Bhikkhu Bodhi's rendering of _devaputta_ as 'young deva.' He
says _devaputtas_ are 'young devas newly arisen in their respective heavenly
planes' (CDB p.75).

Only bhikkhus of the Sakyan clan were given the -_putto_ suffix, not other
clans.

===== Gotamo Sakyaputto: shades of glory

But Gotamo Sakyaputto could not possibly mean 'Gotama, the young Sakyan
bhikkhu.' Here _sakyaputto_ has shades of glory. We treat it accordingly: 'the
Sakyans' Son':

[quote, D.3.196]
____
Glory to Aṅgīrasa, the Sakyans' radiant Son.

_aṅgīrasassa namatthu sakyaputtassa sirīmato._
____

===== Sakyaputtiya: disciple of the Sakyans' Son

_Sakyaputtiya_ is a compound, says PED: _sakyaputta+iya_ 'belonging to the
Sakyans' Son,' which we take as 'disciple of the Sakyans' Son.'

===== Bhikkhunī: [spiritual] daughter of the Sakyan

The comparable term for bhikkhunī is _samaṇī sakyadhītā_ (Vin.4.220):
'female ascetic, [spiritual] daughter of the Sakyan.' The Buddha likewise
called bhikkhus his spiritual sons:

[quote, It.101]
____
You are my spiritual sons, born of my mouth, born of the teaching.

_Tassa me tumhe puttā orasā mukhato jātā dhammajā._
____

_Orasa_ means 'true or legitimate,' says DOP.

==== Introduction

===== Introduction: saṅkappa and vitakka

The following quotes show that _saṅkappa_ and _vitakka_ are synonyms:

1. Unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome thoughts (_vitakkā_) are 'flies.'... On
him who does not guard the senses of sight and hearing, whose sense faculties
are unrestrained [from attraction and repulsion, through mindfulness], his
thoughts (_saṅkappā_) bound up with attachment will attack him like flies.
+
****
_Pāpakā akusalā vitakkā makkhikā... Aguttaṃ cakkhusotasmiṃ indriyesu
asaṃvutaṃ makkhikā anupatissanti saṅkappā rāganissitā_ (A.1.280).
****

2. But where, carpenter, are these spiritually wholesome thoughts
(_saṅkappā_) stopped without remainder? Their ending is spoken of too. As to
this, carpenter, a bhikkhu, with the subsiding of thinking (_vitakka_) and
pondering... enters and abides in second jhāna. Here do these spiritually
wholesome thoughts (_saṅkappā_) cease without remainder.
+
****
_Ime ca thapati kusalasaṅkappā kuhiṃ aparisesā nirujjhanti. Nirodhopi

samādhijaṃ pītisukhaṃ dutiyaṃjhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. Etthete
kusalasaṅkappā aparisesā nirujjhanti_ (M.2.27-8).
****

3. Whatever thought (_saṅkappaṃ_) I wish to think, I think. Whatever
thought I do not wish to think, I do not think. Indeed, brahman, I am master of
the mind in the ways of thought (_vitakkapathe_).
+

Comment:

-_ttāya_ indicates a neuter abstract noun in the genitive or dative case and
therefore expresses the state

nature or quality of being that which is denoted by the noun (PGPL, para 581).
The dative case indicates the place to which motion is directed: 'a few go to
heaven'; 'he takes me to the water' (PGPL, para597.viii). I have taken this
meaning here, using the dative case to indicate the result of originative
activity.

[quote, M.1.111]
____
What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one perceptually
entrenches. Due to what one perceptually entrenches, entrenched perception and
conception assail a man in relation to visible objects known via the visual
sense whether past, future, or present.

Lord of the Devas, the basis, origin, object of genesis and production, of
thought is entrenched perception and conception. When there is entrenched
perception and conception, thought arises. Without entrenched perception and
conception, there is no thought.

[quote, It.53]
____
Beings who perceive [only] what can be expressed and are entrenched in what can
be expressed, not profoundly understanding what is expressed, they come under
the yoke of death;

_Akkheyyasaññino sattā akkheyyasmiṃ patiṭṭhitā. +
Akkheyyaṃ apariññāya yogamāyanti maccuno._

But if one profoundly understands what can be expressed, and does not think 'I
am the expressor,' the mind's liberation is achieved, the unsurpassed Peaceful
State.

_Akkheyyañca pariññāya akkhātāraṃ na maññati +
Phūṭṭho vimokkho manasā santipadamanuttaraṃ._

Perfectly understanding what can be expressed, the Peaceful One delights in the
Peaceful State.

_Sa ce akkheyyasampanno santo santipade rato_

The one who is blessed with profound knowledge, being established in
righteousness, though he makes use of conception he is beyond the limits of
conception.

==== Introduction

===== Active and passive sense, and rendering saṅkhārakkhandha

_Saṅkhāra_ has either an active or passive sense, meaning either:

1. 'the things that are produced by a combination of co-operating factors,' or

2. 'factors (or forces) that function together in producing an effect.' (Bodhi,
MLDB Intro p.55).

We call these 1) 'originated phenomena' and 2) 'originative factors.'

For example:

1. The ignorant Everyman considers bodily form to be the [absolute] Selfhood.
That considering is an originated phenomenon. What is the basis, origin, object
of genesis and production of that originated phenomenon? When the ignorant
Everyman is affected by sense impression born of sensation and uninsightfulness
into reality, craving arises. That originated phenomenon is born from that.
+
****
_rūpaṃ attato samanupassati. Yā kho pana sā bhikkhave samanupassanā
saṅkhāro so. So pana saṅkhāro kinnidāno kiṃsamudayo kiñjātiko
kimpabhavoti. Avijjāsamphassajena bhikkhave vedayitena phuṭṭhassa
assutavato puthujjanassa uppannā taṇhā. Tatojo so saṅkhāro_ (S.3.96).
****

2. There has arisen in me this faculty of psychological pain. That arises with
grounds, with a source, with originative factors, with necessary conditions. It
would be impossible for that faculty of psychological pain to arise without
grounds, without a source, without originative factors, without necessary
conditions.'
+
****
_uppannaṃ kho me idaṃ domanassindriyaṃ. Tañca kho sanimittaṃ
sanidānaṃ sasaṅkhāraṃ sappaccayaṃ. Taṃ vata animittaṃ anidānaṃ
asaṅkhāraṃ appaccayaṃ domanassindriyaṃ uppajjissatī ti netaṃ
ṭhānaṃ vijjati_ (S.5.214).
****

===== Saṅkhārakkhandha: the aggregate of intentional activities

In some circumstances _saṅkhāra_ means activity, not necessarily intentional:

[quote, M.1.301]
____
In-breathing and out-breathing are bodily activity. Thinking and pondering are
speech activity. Perception and sense impression are mental activity.

_Assāsapassāsā kho āvuso visākha kāyasaṅkhāro vitakkavicārā
vacīsaṅkhāro saññā ca vedanā ca cittasaṅkhāro ti._
____

But _saṅkhārakkhandha_ is defined in terms of _cetanā_ and _sañcetanā_.
We therefore render it as 'the aggregate of intentional activities':

[quote, S.3.60]
____
What are intentional activities (i.e. _saṅkhārakkhandha_)? The aggregate of
intentionality (_cetanākāyā_) is sixfold: intentionality concerning visible
objects, audible objects, smellable objects, tasteable objects, tangible
objects, and mentally known objects.

_katame ca bhikkhave saṅkhārā. Chayime bhikkhave cetanākāyā.
Rūpasañcetanā saddasañcetanā gandhasañcetanā rasasañcetanā
phoṭṭhabbasañcetanā dhammasañcetanā._
____

The Visuddhimagga calls _saṅkhārakkhandha_ 'formations'
(_saṅkhatamabhisaṅkharontīti kho, bhikkhave, tasmā saṅkhārā ti
vuccantī ti_). But Bhikkhu Bodhi calls this analysis 'later, more elaborate'
(CDB p.841). Bodhi himself call the aggregate 'volitional formations.'

For discussion on calling _cetanā_ intentionality, not intention, see Glossary
sv _Cetanā_.

===== The abhi- prefix

With acts of psychic power the _abhi_- prefix is applied consistently. In some
words, like 'aspiration,' it sometimes occurs, sometimes not, and is without
significance.

- Then the Blessed One performed an act of psychic power (_tathārūpaṃ
iddhābhisaṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkhāsi_) such that the brahman Brahmāyu saw
that the Blessed One's penis was enclosed in a sheath (M.2.143).

_Passatha bhikkhave sā cevimassa pabbatassa samaññā antarahitā. Te ca

Thus unlasting are originated phenomena, thus unenduring are originated
phenomena, thus unconsoling are originated phenomena. It is time enough,
bhikkhus, to be disillusioned with all originated phenomena, to be unattached
to them, to be liberated from them.

[quote, S.2.82]
____
Bhikkhus, if someone who has acquiesced in uninsightfulness into reality
undertakes a karmically consequential deed that is meritorious, his stream of
sense consciousness (_viññāṇaṃ_) is furnished with merit;

_Avijjāgatoyaṃ bhikkhave purisapuggalo puññaṃ ce saṅkhāraṃ
abhisaṅkharoti puññopagaṃ hoti viññāṇaṃ._

If he undertakes a karmically consequential deed that is demeritorious, his
stream of sense consciousness is furnished with demerit;

_Apuññaṃ ce saṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharoti apuññopagaṃ hoti
viññāṇaṃ._

If he undertakes a karmically consequential deed that is karmically neutral,
his stream of sense consciousness is furnished with what is karmically neutral.

_Āneñjaṃ ce saṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharoti āneñjūpagaṃ hoti
viññāṇaṃ._

When a bhikkhu has abandoned uninsightfulness into reality (_avijjā_) and
aroused insightfulness into reality (_vijjā_), then, with the fading away of
uninsightfulness into reality and the arising of insightfulness into reality,
he does not undertake a karmically consequential deed that is meritorious,
demeritorious, or karmically neutral.

_Yato kho bhikkhave bhikkhuno avijjā pahīṇā hoti vijjā uppannā so
avijjāvirāgā vijjūppādā neva puññābhisaṅkhāraṃ abhisaṅkharoti.

What are karmically consequential deeds (_saṅkhārā_)? What is the
[co-conditional] origination of karmically consequential deeds? What is the
[co-conditional] ending? What is the practice leading to the ending?

[quote, M.1.54]
____
Karmically consequential deeds are threefold: by way of body, speech, and mind.

_Tayome āvuso saṅkhārā: kāyasaṅkhāro vacīsaṅkhāro
cittasaṅkhāro._

With the origination of uninsightfulness into reality comes the origination of
karmically consequential deeds.

_Avijjāsamudayā saṅkhārasamudayo._

With the ending of uninsightfulness into reality comes the ending of karmically
consequential deeds.

_Avijjānirodhā saṅkhāranirodho._

==== Saṅkhāra and effort

===== Introduction: saṅkhāra and effort

_Saṅkhāra_ is one of the factors of the four paths to psychic power
(_cattāro iddhipāde_). And these four roads are one of the seven groups of
factors conducive to enlightenment (_sattannaṃ bodhipakkhiyānaṃ
dhammānaṃ_, D.3.97; It.96). We will first review these groups.

===== Introduction: the seven groups of factors conducive to enlightenment

The seven groups of factors conducive to enlightenment are:

[quote, M.2.238]
____
1. the [contemplation of the] four bases of mindfulness: _cattāro satipaṭṭhānā_

2. the four modes of right inward striving: _cattāro sammappadhāneā_

3. the four paths to psychic power: _cattāro iddhipādā_

4. the five spiritual faculties: _pañcindriyāni_

5. the five spiritual powers: _pañca balāni_

6. the seven factors of enlightenment: _satta bojjhaṅgā_

7. the noble eightfold path: _ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo._
____

===== Introduction: the four paths to psychic power

Let us consider the first of the four paths to psychic power:

[quote, S.5.268]
____
The path to psychic power involving inward collectedness based on desire
accompanied by the efforts of inward striving.

_chandasamādhi-padhānasaṅkhārasamannāgato iddhipādo._
____

In the context of the four paths to psychic power, therefore, we render
_saṅkhāra_ as 'effort.' The efforts of inward striving are fourfold, as the
following passage explains:

===== Introduction: the four efforts of inward striving

The four 'efforts of inward striving' (_padhānasaṅkhārā_) are:

1. To prevent the arising of unarisen spiritually unwholesome factors...
+
****
_So anuppannānaṃ pāpakānaṃ akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ anuppādāya..._
****

2. To abandon arisen unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors...
+
****
_Uppannānaṃ pāpakānaṃ akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ pahānāya..._
****

3. To arouse unarisen spiritually wholesome factors...
+
****
_Anuppannānaṃ kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ uppādāya..._
****

4. To maintain arisen spiritually wholesome factors, to support their nondecay,
increase, expansion, and perfection through spiritual cultivation...
+
****
_Uppannānaṃ kusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ ṭhitiyā asammosāya bhiyyobhāvāya
vepullāya bhāvanāya pāripūriyā..._
****

[quote, S.5.268]
____
(...) he stirs up eagerness, endeavours, applies energy, exerts his mind, and
strives.

_chandaṃ janeti vāyamati viriyaṃ ārabhati cittaṃ paggaṇhāti
padahati._

(...) These are called the efforts of inward striving.

_ime vuccanti padhānasaṅkhārā._
____

Comment:

The four 'efforts of inward striving' (_padhānasaṅkhārā_) are equivalent
to the 'four modes of right inward striving,' mentioned above (_cattāro
sammappadhānā_: S.5.244). The 'efforts of inward striving' therefore simply
means 'inward striving.' The word 'efforts' (_saṅkhārā_) is redundant.

perceives the loathsome nature of digestion.

_āhāre paṭikkūlasaññī._

perceives disgust for the whole world [of phenomena].

_sabbaloke anabhiratasaññī._

contemplates the unlastingness of all originated phenomena.

_sabbasaṅkhāresu aniccānupassī._

and for whom the perception of [the ever-present possibility of] death is
well-established within himself.

In what way is a person liberated effortlessly in this very lifetime?

_Kathañca bhikkhave puggalo diṭṭheva dhamme asaṅkhāraparinibbāyī hoti?_

In this regard a bhikkhu is one who enters and abides in first... fourth jhāna:

____
If any ascetics or Brahmanists describe the entering upon this base [neither

regarding what is to be seen, heard, sensed, or cognised, that is declared to
be a disaster for entering upon this base.

_Ye hi keci bhikkhave samaṇā vā brāhmaṇā vā

For this base is not to be attained as an attainment with effort, but with a
residue of effort.

==== Saṅkhāra and mindfulness with breathing

===== Saṅkhāra in mindfulness with breathing: untranquillising factors

In this section, we will explore the meaning of _saṅkhāra_ as it occurs in
mindfulness with breathing, and will show it can be rendered as
'untranquillising factors' of body and mind.

===== Mindfulness with breathing and saṅkhāra

Mindfulness with breathing (_ānāpānasati_) involves training oneself as
follows:

'I will breathe in... I will breathe out:

[quote, M.1.425]
____
experiencing the whole body

_sabbakāyapaṭisaṃvedī assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti sikkhati_

tranquillising bodily _saṅkhāra_

_passambhayaṃ kāyasaṅkhāraṃ assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti
sikkhati_

experiencing mental _saṅkhāra_

_cittasaṅkhārapaṭisaṃvedī assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti
sikkhati_

tranquillising mental _saṅkhāra_

_passambhayaṃ cittasaṅkhāraṃ assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti
sikkhati._
____

To establish the meaning of _saṅkhāra_, let us see what factors are
tranquillised in mindfulness with breathing.

===== Tranquillisation in mindfulness with breathing

The factors tranquillised in mindfulness with breathing are:

1. Trembling and unsteadiness:
+
[quote, S.5.316]
____
It is when inward collectedness by mindfulness with breathing has been
developed and cultivated that no trembling or unsteadiness arises either in
body or mind.

_ānāpānasatisamādhissa bhikkhave bhāvitattā bahulīkatattā neva
kāyassa iñjitattaṃ vā hoti phanditattaṃ vā na cittassa iñjitattaṃ
vā hoti phanditattaṃ vā._
____

2. Discursive thinking:
+
[quote, Ud.37]
____
Mindfulness with breathing should be developed to cut off discursive thinking

_ānāpānasati bhāvetabbā vitakkupacchedāya._
____

3. Four factors that are quelled with jhāna:
+
[quote, S.4.218]
____
quelling of speech in first jhāna

_vācā paṭippassaddhā hoti_

quelling of thinking and pondering in second jhāna

_vitakkavicārā paṭippassaddhā honti_

quelling of rapture in third jhāna

_pīti paṭippassaddhā hoti_

quelling of breathing in fourth jhāna

_assāsapassāsā paṭippassaddhā._
____

These quotes therefore indicate seven possible meanings of the _saṅkhāra_
that is tranquillised in mindfulness with breathing:

1. trembling of body and mind

2. unsteadiness of body and mind

3. discursive thinking

4. speech

5. thinking and pondering

6. rapture

7. breathing

===== Further study of the jhānas

In the search for the meaning of _saṅkhāra,_ we will see that tranquillity
is not perfected until fourth jhāna. That is, whereas the first three jhānas
are reckoned as unstable, fourth jhāna is stable. This stabilisation of body
and mind seems the very essence of tranquillisation, and must surely be
included in our search. First we will consider the duality of tranquillity.

===== The duality of tranquillity

We have seen above that in mindfulness with breathing, tranquillity is applied
to _saṅkhāra_ both bodily and mentally (i.e. _passambhayaṃ
kāyasaṅkhāraṃ assasissāmī ti... passambhayaṃ cittasaṅkhāraṃ
assasissāmī ti_). This duality of tranquillity is firmly acknowledged
elsewhere in the scriptures:

[quote, S.5.103-108]
____
There are tranquillity of body, tranquillity of mind.

_Atthi bhikkhave kāyapassaddhi cittappassaddhi._
____

Both aspects of tranquillity, of body and mind, result from rapture:

[quote, S.5.68]
____
For one whose mind is rapturous, the body becomes tranquil and the mind
becomes tranquil, and this is the arousing of the enlightenment factor of
tranquillity

_Pītimanassa kāyopi passambhati cittampi passambhati. Yasmiṃ samaye
bhikkhave bhikkhuno pītimanassa kāyopi passambhati cittampi passambhati
passaddhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṃ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti._
____

This implies that tranquillity would be found the first two jhānas, because:

1. first jhāna involves rapture and physical pleasure born of seclusion
+
****
_vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ_
****

2. second jhāna involves rapture and physical pleasure born of inward
collectedness
+
****
_samādhijaṃ pītisukhaṃ dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ_ (M.1.454-5).
****

Nonetheless, perfect meditative tranquillity is not to be found in first and
second jhāna, because it is definitively linked only to fourth jhāna, as
follows.

===== Bodily tranquillity and fourth jhāna

The scriptures associate tranquillity of bodily _saṅkhāra_ with fourth
jhāna, as follows:

[quote, D.3.270]
____
How is a bhikkhu one whose bodily _saṅkhāra_ has been tranquillised?

_Kathañca bhikkhave bhikkhu passaddhakāyasaṅkhāro hoti?_

(...) In this regard, with the abandonment of physical pleasure and pain, and
following the vanishing of psychological pleasure and pain, a bhikkhu enters
and abides in fourth jhāna, which is free of pleasure and pain, and [is imbued
with] purified detached awareness and mindfulness.

_Idhāvuso bhikkhu sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā pubbeva
somanassadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamā adukkhamasukhaṃ
upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati._
____

===== The Buddha's teaching on 'the unstable'

This definitive association of tranquillity with fourth jhāna corresponds to
the teaching on 'the unstable.' The Buddha said that whereas instability is
associated with the first three jhānas, it is abolished in fourth jhāna, as
follows:

[quote, M.1.454-5]
____
In this regard a bhikkhu... enters and abides in first jhāna... That, I
declare, is within the unstable. What there is within the unstable? The
thinking and pondering that are unended.

_Idhūdāyi bhikkhu... paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. Idaṃ kho
ahaṃ udāyi iñjitasmiṃ vadāmi. Kiñca tattha iñjitasmiṃ: yadeva tattha
vitakkavicārā aniruddhā honti_

(...) A bhikkhu enters and abides in second jhāna. That, I declare, is within
the unstable. What there is within the unstable? The rapture and physical
pleasure that are unended.

_dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. Idampi kho ahaṃ udāyi
iñjitasmiṃ vadāmi. Kiñca tattha iñjitasmiṃ: yadeva tattha pītisukhaṃ
aniruddhaṃ hoti._

(...) He enters and abides in third jhāna... That, I declare, is within the
unstable. What there is within the unstable? The serenity with physical
pleasure that is unended.

_tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. Idampi kho ahaṃ udāyi
iñjitasmiṃ vadāmi. Kiñca tattha iñjitasmiṃ: yadeva tattha
upekkhāsukhaṃ aniruddhaṃ hoti._

(...) With the abandonment of physical pleasure and pain, and following the
vanishing of psychological pleasure and pain, a bhikkhu enters and abides in
fourth jhāna, which is free of pleasure and pain, and [is imbued with]
purified detached awareness and mindfulness. Now that, I declare, is within the
not-unstable.

_Idhūdāyi bhikkhu sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā pubbeva
somanassadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamā adukkhaṃ asukhaṃ
upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. Idaṃ
kho ahaṃ udāyi aniñjitasmiṃ vadāmi._
____

Thus any tranquillity occurring below fourth jhāna is part of 'instability.'
Only in fourth jhāna does tranquillity reach its consummation. This gives us
an eighth possible meaning for the _saṅkhāra_ that is tranquillised in
mindfulness with breathing: 'instability.'

===== Conclusion: the advantages of tautology

We have said that in mindfulness with breathing, tranquillity is applied to
_saṅkhāra_ both bodily and mentally, and we have shown that there are eight
possible explanations for _saṅkhāra_. All these meanings can be captured
with a noun that produces a tautology. In other words, what is tranquillised in
mindfulness with breathing is 'untranquillising factors.' Although
_saṅkhāraṃ_ is a singular, we treat it as a plural, because that is in
accordance with this quote:

[quote, M.1.301]
____
In-breathing and out-breathing are bodily activity. Thinking and pondering are
speech activity. Perception and sense impression are mental activity.

_Assāsapassāsā kho āvuso visākha kāyasaṅkhāro vitakkavicārā
vacīsaṅkhāro saññā ca vedanā ca cittasaṅkhāro ti._
____

Thus the _ānāpānasati_ formulae can be translated accordingly:

- I will breathe in... I will breathe out:

[quote, M.1.425]
____
(...) experiencing the whole body

_sabbakāyapaṭisaṃvedī assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti sikkhati_

(...) tranquillising bodily untranquillising factors

_passambhayaṃ kāyasaṅkhāraṃ assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti
sikkhati_

(...) experiencing mental untranquillising factors

_cittasaṅkhārapaṭisaṃvedī assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti
sikkhati_

(...) tranquillising mental untranquillising factors

_passambhayaṃ cittasaṅkhāraṃ assasissāmī ti... passasissāmī ti
sikkhati._
____

====
saṅkhāro

untranquillising factors
====

[quote, A.2.41]
____
And how is a bhikkhu one whose bodily untranquillising factors have been
tranquillised?

_Kathañca bhikkhave bhikkhu passaddhakāyasaṅkhāro hoti?_

In this regard a bhikkhu, with the abandonment of physical pleasure and pain,
and following the vanishing of psychological pleasure and pain, he enters and
abides in fourth jhāna, which is free of pleasure and pain, and [is imbued
with] purified detached awareness and mindfulness.

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā pubbeva
somanassadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamā adukkhaṃ asukhaṃ
upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati._

That is how a bhikkhu is one whose bodily untranquillising factors have been
tranquillised.

_Evaṃ kho bhikkhave bhikkhu passaddhakāyasaṅkhāro hoti._

[quote, M.1.296]
____
Friend, the factors essential to life are not things that must be experienced.
If they were, then a bhikkhu who attains the ending of perception and sense
impression would not be seen to emerge from it.

_Na kho āvuso teva āyusaṅkhārā teva vedanīyā dhammā. Teva kho āvuso
āyusaṅkhārā abhaviṃsu teva vedanīyā dhammā nayidaṃ

____

====
āyusaṅkhārā

====

[quote, S.2.266]
____
As swift as are the sun and moon, and as swift as are the devas that run before
the sun and moon, the factors essential to life perish even more swiftly than
that.

_yathā ca candimasuriyānaṃ javo yathā ca yā devatā candimasuriyānaṃ
purato dhāvanti tāsaṃ devatānaṃ javo tato sīghataraṃ āyusaṅkhārā
khīyanti._

Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: 'We will abide
diligently applied [to the practice]'

_Tasmātiha bhikkhave evaṃ sikkhitabbaṃ appamattā viharissāmā ti._
____

====

====

[quote, M.1.120]
____
If there arise in a bhikkhu unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome thoughts
connected with attachment, hatred, and undiscernment of reality, then he should
pay attention to the dynamic quality of those thoughts

_uppajjanteva pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṃhitāpi
dosūpasaṃhitāpi mohūpasaṃhitāpi tena bhikkhave bhikkhunā tesaṃ
vitakkānaṃ vitakkasaṅkhārasaṇṭhānaṃ manasikātabbaṃ_

(...) It is just as if a man walking fast might ask himself why he is walking
fast. Why not walk slowly? Then walking slowly, why not stand? Then standing,
why not sit? Then sitting, why not lie down? In this way he would substitute
for each more effortful posture one that was less effortful.

_Evaṃ hi so bhikkhave puriso oḷārikaṃ oḷārikaṃ iriyāpathaṃ

And what is the wonder of mind reading. When a bhikkhu has attained a state of
inward collectedness which is void of thinking and reflecting, by encompassing
a person's mind with his mind, he knows that:

____
In the way that this person's mental activities are directed, so his mind will

-- What are these activities of body, speech, and mind?

_Katamo panayye kāyasaṅkhāro katamo vacīsaṅkhāro katamo

-- For what reason?

[quote, M.1.301]
____
-- Because in-breathing and out-breathing are bodily, bound up with the body,
therefore they are bodily activity. And because first one thinks and reflects
before breaking into speech, therefore thinking and pondering are speech
activity. And because perception and sense impression are cognitive, bound up
with cognition, therefore they are mental activity

=== Saṅga; Satta

==== Renderings

- _saṅga_: bond [to individual existence]

- _saṅga_: bondage [to individual existence]

- _satta_: bound [to individual existence]

- _satta_: bound (to some named object)

- _asattā_: liberated [from individual existence]

==== Introduction

===== Saṅga: bond/bondage [to individual existence]

_Saṅga_ is usually rendered as 'tie' or 'bond' or 'attachment.' But
overcoming it is associated with arahantship (_brāhmaṇan_, Ud.6) and wisdom,
or those who are wise (_vijānataṃ_, Dh.v.171; _dhīro_, Sn.v.250;
_tathāgato_ Sn.v.473). It is a synonym of _saṃyojana_ (Dh.v.342). Thus it is
not just bond/bondage, but bond/bondage [to individual existence].

[quote, Ud.6]
____
Saṅgāmajiṃ, free of bondage [to individual existence], he is what I call a
Brahman.

_Saṅgā saṅgāmajiṃ muttaṃ tamahaṃ brūmi brāhmaṇan ti._
____

[quote, Dh.v.342]
____
Attached by ties and bonds [to individual existence], they end up with
suffering again and again for a long time.

_Saṃyojanasaṅgasattakā dukkhamupenti punappunaṃ cirāya._
____

===== Saṅgātīto: transcended the bonds [to individual existence]

_Saṅgātīto_ ('one who has transcended the bonds [to individual existence]')
is associated with _visaṃyutto_ ('one who is emancipated [from individual
existence]'):

[quote, Th.v.1022]
____
One whose _āsavas_ are destroyed, who is emancipated [from individual
existence], who has transcended the bonds [to individual existence], one who is
inwardly at complete peace, he bears his last body having gone beyond birth and
death.

_Khīṇāsavo visaṃyutto saṅgātīto sunibbuto +
Dhāreti antimaṃ dehaṃ jātimaraṇapāragū._
____

===== Saṅgātigataṃ: overcome all bonds [to individual existence]

_Saṅgātigataṃ_ ('one who has overcome all bonds [to individual
existence]') is associated with _bhavassa pāragun ti_ (one who has gone beyond
individual existence, Th.v.38):

[quote, Th.v.38]
____
The devas venerate him, that great sage who has overcome all bonds [to
individual existence] and gone beyond individual existence..

_Taṃ sabbasaṅgātigataṃ mahāmuniṃ devā namassanti bhavassa pāragun
ti._
____

These, and other quotes below, show that _saṅga_ means bondage [to individual
existence], not just bondage.

===== Varieties and numbers of saṅgas

The number of _saṅgas_ is unsettled. The scriptures say there are either five
(_pañcasaṅgātigo bhikkhu_ Th.v.633; S.1.3) or seven
(_sattasaṅgapahīṇassa_ It.94), the members of which are explained
differently in the commentaries, as follows:

1. The commentaries to Th.v.633 and S.1.3 list the five _saṅga_ as
_rāgasaṅgo dosasaṅgo mohasaṅgo mānasaṅgo diṭṭhisaṅgo_.

2. The commentary to It.94 lists the seven _saṅgas_ as _taṇhāsaṅgo
diṭṭhisaṅgo mānasaṅgo kodhasaṅgo avijjāsaṅgo kilesasaṅgo
duccaritasaṅgo ti_.

3. The commentary to It.94 adds that some say the _saṅgas_ are the seven
proclivites (_sattānusayā_) namely: _kāmarāgānusaya paṭighānusaya
diṭṭhānusaya vicikicchānusaya mānānusaya bhavarāga avijjā_ (A.4.7-9).

4. In the _Dhotaka Sutta_, the Buddha says all known objects are _saṅga_:

[quote, Sn.v.1068]
____
Whatever you know, above, below, across, and also in the middle, knowing this
to be a bond [to individual existence] in the world, do not foster craving for
any state of individual existence.

_Yaṃ kiñci sampajānāsi uddhaṃ adho tiriyañcāpi majjhe +
Etaṃ viditvā saṅgo ti loke bhavābhavāya mākāsi taṇhan ti._
____

===== Satta

_Satta_ is related to _saṅga_, because both stem from _sajjati_. Like
_saṅga_, if no object is specified, the object of _satta_ is individual
existence. We call it 'bound,' or 'bound [to individual existence].'

[quote, A.4.57]
____
Taking delight in and bound to her femininity.

_Itthatte bhikkhave abhiratā sattā._

____

Why is 'bondage [to individual existence]' an epithet for sensuous pleasures?

_Kasmā ca bhikkhave saṅgoti kāmānametaṃ adhivacanaṃ_

Because one who is passionately attached to sensuous pleasure, fastened by
fondness and attachment, is neither free of bonds [to individual existence] in
this lifetime, nor in the hereafter, therefore 'bondage [to individual
existence]' is an epithet for sensuous pleasures.

_yasmā ca kāmarāgarattāyaṃ bhikkhave chandarāgavinibaddho

===== Arahants perceive without mental images

Arahants perceive objects as they are, without any associated mental images:

[quote, Sn.v.802]

He does not conceive the slightest mental image regarding what is seen,
heard, sensed, or cognised.

===== Arahants are susceptible to virtuous mental images

Arahants are nonetheless susceptible to virtuous mental images:

[quote, Th.v.589]
____
Just as the Veramba wind blows clouds in the rainy season, so [in the city of
Veramba] mental images connected with physical seclusion [would] overwhelm me.

The Buddha was fully conscious of mental images:

[quote, M.3.124]

In this regard, Ānanda, the arising, continuance, and vanishing of sense
impressions (_vedanā_), mental images (_saññā_), and thoughts (_vitakkā_)
is known by the Perfect One.

===== The arahant is free of unvirtuous and deluding mental images

So when the suttas say that the arahant is free of mental images, this would
mean that he is free of:

1. unvirtuous mental images, and

2. deluding images

We parenthesise accordingly. This is justified, because in the
_Madhupiṇḍika Sutta_, where the following quote comes from, the Buddha
explains how his teaching does not lead to unwholesome consequences. This
rationally means that the mental images he is condemning are those which are
unwholesome. The usual combination of words used in the scriptures to capture
unwholesome connotations is _pāpakā akusala_, i.e. 'unvirtuous and
spiritually unwholesome.' We use this parenthesis here, for example:

[quote, M.1.108]
____
[I proclaim] a doctrine, friend, such that... one does not abide quarrelling
with anyone in the world; such that for the Brahman who abides emancipated from
sensuous pleasures, free of uncertainty [about the significance of the
teaching], free of anxiety, free of craving for all states of individual
existence, [unvirtuous and spiritually unwholesome] mental images do not lurk
within him.

_yathāvādī kho āvuso... na kenaci loke viggayha tiṭṭhati yathā ca pana

===== Solving the Kalahavivāda Sutta

To solve the puzzle of the _Kalahavivāda Sutta_ (Sn.v.873-4), we render
_saññā_ as 'mental images,' as follows:

[quote, Sn.v.873]
____
[Question:] 'For one attained to what state does bodily form vanish? Whether
pleasant or painful, how does it vanish? Tell me this, how does it vanish? My
objective is that we should know this.'

_Kathaṃ sametassa vibhoti rūpaṃ sukhaṃ dukkhaṃ vāpi kathaṃ vibhoti +
Etaṃ me pabrūhi yathā vibhoti taṃ jāniyāmāti me mano ahu_
____

[quote, Sn.v.874]
____
[Answer:] 'He does not perceive mental images [of what is seen, heard, sensed,
or cognised]. He does not perceive [what is seen, heard, sensed, or cognised]
with deranged perception. He is not without perception. He does not perceive
what has vanished. For one arrived at such a state, bodily form vanishes.
Mental images are indeed the source of entrenched conception.'

The six perceptions leading to the profound understanding [and destruction of

2. the perception that what is unlasting is existentially void (_anicce dukkhasaññā_)

3. the perception that what is existentially void is void of personal qualities (_dukkhe anattasaññā_)

4. the perception of the abandonment [of sensuous thoughts, unbenevolent
thoughts, malicious thoughts, and unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome factors]
(_pahānasaññā_)

'The profound understanding [and destruction of the great masses of greed,

For him the mental imagery of previous sensuous pleasure ceases.

_Tassa yā purimā kāmasaññā sā nirujjhati._

And at that time there is a subtle but true perception of the rapture and

=== Satipaṭṭhānā

==== Renderings

- _satipaṭṭhānā_: bases of mindfulness (_Samudaya Sutta_)

- _satipaṭṭhāna_: the [contemplation of the] bases of mindfulness
(_Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta_).

- _satipaṭṭhāna_: basic practice of mindfulness (_Vibhaṅga Sutta_).

- _satipaṭṭhānā_: opportunities for mindfulness (_Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga
Sutta_).

==== Introduction

===== Samudaya Sutta: base of mindfulness

The commentaries offer two possible etymologies of _satipaṭṭhāna_, via
either an action noun ('establishment') or a non-action noun ('base'), thus:

- _sati + upaṭṭhāna_ (action noun): 'the four establishments of
mindfulness'

- _sati + paṭṭhāna_ (non-action noun): 'the four bases of mindfulness.'

In the _Samudaya Sutta_ (S.5.184) _satipaṭṭhāna_ is presented in terms of
the [co-conditional] origination and [co-conditional] vanishing of the body and
other objects of mindfulness. The sutta begins:

[quote, S.5.184]
____
Bhikkhus, I will teach you the [co-conditional] origination and
[co-conditional] vanishing of the four bases of mindfulness. Please listen. And
what is the [co-conditional] origination of the body? With the origination of
food comes the origination of the body.

_catunnaṃ bhikkhave satipaṭṭhānānaṃ samudayañca atthaṅgamañca
desissāmi. Taṃ suṇātha. Ko ca bhikkhave kāyassa samudayo.
Āhārasamudayā kāyassa samudayo._
____

Here _satipaṭṭhāna_ is represented by 'body,' a non-action noun. Therefore
_satipaṭṭhāna_ is 'base,' not 'establishment.'

===== Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta: the [contemplation of the] bases of mindfulness

The _Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta_ (M.1.56) says:

____
This is the one-destination path for the purification of beings... namely, the
four _satipaṭṭhānā_. What four? In this regard a bhikkhu abides
contemplating the nature of the body etc.

_ekāyano ayaṃ bhikkhave maggo sattānaṃ visuddhiyā... yadidaṃ cattāro
satipaṭṭhānā. Katame cattāro? Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu kāye
kāyānupassī viharati...._
____

Thus the one-destination path is said to be:

1. four bases ('the four _satipaṭṭhānā_')

2. the contemplation of those bases

The one-destination path would not be simply four bases, but rather the
contemplation of those bases_._ In which case 'four _satipaṭṭhānā_' is an
abbreviation, to be parenthesised like this:

____
This is the one-destination path for the purification of beings... namely, the
[contemplation of the] four bases of mindfulness.'

_ekāyano ayaṃ bhikkhave maggo... yadidaṃ cattāro satipaṭṭhānā._
____

Here, _satipaṭṭhānā_ is again linked to non-action nouns, so again means
'bases of mindfulness.'

===== Vibhaṅga Sutta: basic practice of mindfulness

The _Vibhaṅga Sutta_ (S.5.183) is unusual for two reasons. Firstly,
_satipaṭṭhāna_ occurs in singular case even in reference to all four
bases. Secondly, the context suggests _paṭṭhāna_ means 'basic practice'
because it is contrasted with 'development.'

[quote, S.5.183]
____
I will teach you the basic practice of mindfulness, and the development of the
basic practice of mindfulness

_satipaṭṭhānañca vo bhikkhave desissāmi satipaṭṭhānaṃ
bhāvanañca._

And what is the basic practice of mindfulness?

_Katamañca bhikkhave satipaṭṭhānaṃ_

In this regard a bhikkhu abides contemplating the nature of the body... sense
impressions... the mind... the nature of certain objects of the systematic
teachings, vigorously, fully consciously, and mindfully, having eliminated
greed and dejection in regard to the world [of phenomena].

_idha bhikkhave bhikkhu kāye kāyānupassī... dhammesu dhammānupassī
viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ._

And what is the development of the basic practice of mindfulness?

_Katamā ca bhikkhave satipaṭṭhānabhāvanā_

In this regard a bhikkhu abides contemplating [co-conditional] origination in
relation to the body etc... [co-conditional] disappearance in relation to the
body etc... [co-conditional] origination and disappearance in relation to the
body etc, vigorously, fully consciously, and mindfully, having eliminated greed
and dejection in regard to the world [of phenomena].

_idha bhikkhave bhikkhu samudayadhammānupassī... vayadhammānupassī...
samudayavayadhammānupassī kāyasmiṃ viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā
vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṃ._
____

That _paṭṭhāna_ could mean 'basic' is surprising. This meaning is more
apparent in later Pāli literature, as Rhys Davids explains:

- The mediaeval use of _paṭṭhāna_ (in its Sanskrit form) was in the sense
of 'starting off,' 'going away,' 'departure.' It is the title of the most often
quoted book in the Abhidhamma, and there means probably 'Origins,'
'Starting-points,' as it gives under twenty-four categories the paccayas
(causes) of phenomena -- Dialogues of the Buddha (Dial.2.324).

===== Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga Sutta: opportunities for mindfulness

Finally, we consider the three _satipaṭṭhāna_ (_tayo satipaṭṭhānā_)
of the _Saḷāyatanavibhaṅga Sutta_. The sutta says a teacher's disciples
may or may not listen to him. These challenges for the teacher are called
'opportunities for mindfulness' because for the accomplished teacher they are
opportunities to establish in himself mindfulness and full consciousness (_sato
sampajāno_). The humorous overtones of this are obvious.

===== Contemplating [co-conditional] origination in relation to phenomena: advanced mindfulness

To abide contemplating origination and disappearance is called 'the development
of the basic practice of mindfulness' (_satipaṭṭhānabhāvanā_, S.5.183).
We use the term '[co-conditional] origination' as suggested by the following
quote:

[co-conditional] vanishing of the four bases of mindfulness. Please listen.

==== Introduction

===== Saddhā: faith

_Saddhā_ can sometimes be rendered simply as faith:

[quote, S.5.221]
____
They would have to go by faith in others about this.

_te tattha paresaṃ saddhāya gaccheyyuṃ._

destined for heaven.

_yesaṃ mayi saddhāmattaṃ pemamattaṃ sabbe te saggaparāyaṇāti._
____

===== Saddhā: technical sense

In relation to the Buddha _saddhā_ has a technical sense, meaning faith in the
perfection of his transcendent insight. This is also the case where he is not
the stated object of _saddhā_ because the definition for _saddhindriyaṃ_
shows that in such cases he is still the object:

[quote, S.5.196]
____
And what is the faculty of faith? In this regard, the noble disciple has faith.
He has faith in the [perfection of the] Perfect One's transcendent insight: 'He
is indeed the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, perfect
in insightfulness into reality and in conduct, the Sublime One, one who knows
the world [of phenomena] [according to reality], the unexcelled trainer of men
to be tamed, the teacher of devas and men, the Enlightened One, the Blessed
One.'

_Katamañca bhikkhave saddhindriyaṃ idha bhikkhave ariyasāvako saddho hoti

_Saddha_ can be used as an adjective or adverb, 'faithful' or 'in faith':

____
Faithful bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, laymen and laywomen

_saddhā bhikkhū bhikkhuniyo upāsakā upāsikāyo._
____

[quote, D.1.5]
____
Food given in faith

_saddhādeyyāni bhojanāni._
____

===== Saddha: credulous

_Saddha_ sometimes means credulous:

[quote, Sn.v.853]
____
Not infatuated with objects of pleasure, not given to arrogance, gentle,
intuitively insightful, not credulous, not filled with disgust;

_Sātiyesu anassāvī atimāne ca no yuto +
Saṇho ca paṭibhānavā na saddho na virajjati._
____

[quote, Dh.v.97]
____
The man who is not credulous... is the highest human.

_Assaddho... yo naro... sa ve uttamaporiso._
____

===== The Iṇa Sutta: faith in [the significance of abandoning spiritually unwholesome factors and undertaking] spiritually wholesome factors

In the Iṇa Sutta _saddhā_ has a different meaning, which we will research
here:

1. A noble disciple who has unshakeable faith in the teaching (_dhamme
aveccappasādena samannāgato hoti_) has come to the conclusion that:
+
[quote, S.5.390]
____
The teaching is well explained by the Blessed One, fathomable in this lifetime,
realisable in the here and now, intriguing, personally applicable, to be
realised by the wise for themselves._

_svākkhāto bhagavatā dhammo sandiṭṭhiko akāliko ehipassiko opanayiko
paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhī ti._
____
+
In the light of these qualities, the teaching's excellence and effectiveness,
'unshakeable faith in the Dhamma' means 'unshakeable faith in the [significance
of the] teaching.'

2. But in the _Iṇa Sutta_ the object of _saddhā natthi_ is _kusalesu
dhammesu_. For reasons to be explained, we apply the same parenthesis:
'significance of':
+
[quote, A.3.352]
____
Anyone who has no faith in [the significance of abandoning spiritually
unwholesome factors and undertaking] spiritually wholesome factors.

_yassa kassaci saddhā natthi kusalesu dhammesu._
____

3. Applying the same parentheses, i.e. '[significance of],' would only be
justified if 'the teaching' in Quote 1 concerns 'the abandoning of spiritually
unwholesome factors and undertaking of spiritually wholesome factors' in Quote 2. Which it does:
+
[quote, Dh.v.183]
____
The refraining from everything unvirtuous; the undertaking of what is
spiritually wholesome; the purification of one's mind: this is the training
system of the Buddhas.

_Sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṃ kusalassa upasampadā +
Sacittapariyodapanaṃ etaṃ buddhānaṃ sāsanaṃ._
____

4. According to our parenthesis, spiritually unwholesome factors are
'abandoned' and spiritually wholesome factors are 'undertaken'. The parentheses
come from these two quotes:
+
[quote, S.3.8]
____
The Blessed One praises the abandonment of spiritually unwholesome factors.

_bhagavā akusalānaṃ dhammānaṃ pahānaṃ vaṇṇeti._
____

As the Blessed One explained the teaching to me with its increasingly higher
and more sublime levels, concerning what is inwardly dark and bright with their
correlative combinations, thus through transcendent insight into a certain one
of those teachings, I came to a conclusion about the teachings. I gained faith
in the Teacher thus "The Blessed One is perfectly enlightened. The teaching is
well explained by the Blessed One. The community of disciples is applied to an
excellent practice.'

_Yathā yathā me āvuso bhagavā dhammaṃ deseti uttaruttariṃ

When one's faith in the [perfection of the] Perfect One's [transcendent
insight] is settled, rooted, and established, and described in these terms,
words, and phrases, then one's faith is said to be supported by reasons, rooted
in vision [of things according to reality], and firm. It is not shakeable by
any ascetic, Brahmanist, deva, māra, or brahmā, or by anyone in the world.

_Yassa kassa ci bhikkhave imehi ākārehi imehi padehi imehi vyañjanehi

=== Santusita; Santuṭṭha

==== Renderings

- _santusitaṃ_: inwardly at peace

- _santuṭṭha_: content [with what is paltry and easily gotten]

- _santuṭṭha_: content

- _itarītarena santuṭṭha_: content [with what is paltry and easily gotten]

- _itarītarena cīvarena santuṭṭha_: content with any old robe whatsoever

- _asantuṭṭha_: discontented

==== Introduction

===== PED definitions

_Santusita_ and _Santuṭṭha_ are past participles of _santussati_, says PED,
which renders them:

- _Santusita_: 'contented, pleased, happy.'

- _Santuṭṭha_: 'pleased, happy.'

We explain below why we reject both definitions.

===== Santusita

_Santusita_ is consistently associated with other words that indicate
arahantship. To render it 'content' does not represent this situation.
'Inwardly at peace' accords better with its usual contexts:

[quote, Th.v.8]
____
He is heroic, inwardly at peace, and has overcome his unsureness [about the
significance of the teaching].

_vīro santusito vitiṇṇakaṅkho._
____

[quote, S.3.54]
____
Being inwardly at peace, he is not apprehensive. Being not apprehensive, he
realises the Untroubled for himself.

===== Santuṭṭha: factor of asceticism (sāmaññaṅga)

As a 'factor of asceticism' _santuṭṭha_ occurs in the phrase 'content with
what is paltry and easily gotten.' See the following quote. It therefore does
not mean 'content with what one has got':

____
Four things are paltry, easily gotten, and blameless. Which four?

_Cattārimāni bhikkhave appāni ca sulabhāni ca anavajjāni tāni ca.
Katamāni cattāri?_
____

1. In the category of robes, a rag-robe is paltry, easily gotten, and blameless.
+
****
_Paṃsukūlaṃ bhikkhave cīvarānaṃ appañca sulabhañca tañca
anavajjaṃ_
****

2. In the category of meals, food gathered on almsround is paltry, easily
gotten, and blameless.
+
****
_Piṇḍiyālopo bhikkhave bhojanānaṃ appañca sulabhañca tañca
anavajjaṃ_
****

3. In the category of abodes, the root of a tree among abodes is paltry, easily
gotten, and blameless.
+
****
_Rukkhamūlaṃ bhikkhave senāsanānaṃ appañca sulabhañca tañca
anavajjaṃ_
****

4. In the category of remedies, concentrated urine is paltry, easily gotten,
and blameless.
+
****
_Pūtimuttaṃ bhikkhave bhesajjānaṃ appañca sulabhañca tañca anavajjaṃ_
****

[quote, A.2.27]
____
(...) These four things are paltry, easily gotten, and blameless.

_Imāni kho bhikkhave cattāri appāni ca sulabhāni ca tāni anavajjāni_

(...) When a bhikkhu is content with what is paltry and easily gotten, this is
one of the factors of asceticism, I declare.

_Yato kho bhikkhave bhikkhu appena ca santuṭṭho hoti sulabhena ca.
Idamassāhaṃ aññataraṃ sāmaññaṅganti vadāmī ti._
____

Therefore where contexts indicate that 'content' or 'contentment' involve the
factors of asceticism, appropriate parenthesis should be used. For example:

[quote, Vin.1.45]
____
Having spoken in dispraise of being discontented [with what is paltry and
easily gotten]...

_asantuṭṭhiyā avaṇṇaṃ bhāsitvā._
____

[quote, Vin.1.45]
____
Having spoken in praise of being content [with what is paltry and easily
gotten]...

_santuṭṭhassa vaṇṇaṃ bhāsitvā._
____

===== With itarītarena alone

In some cases the object of _santuṭṭha_ is given as _itarītarena_. This
could be rendered as 'content with any old thing.' PED renders _itarītara_ as
'one or the other, whatsoever, any;' DOP says 'one or another; whatsoever, any
sort of.' Norman says 'whatever comes one's way' (Th.v.230). But we render it
by repeating the parenthesis given above. For example:

[quote, Th.v.230]
____
One should be content [with what is paltry and easily gotten].

_Itarītarena tusseyya._
____

Rendering _itarītarena_ as 'with what is paltry and easily gotten' has the
following advantages:

1. it is precise

2. it avoids possible misinterpretation ('content with anything whatsoever').
But, for example, even Sāriputta's verses would deny a bhikkhu is 'content
with anything whatsoever':
+
[quote, Th.v.985]
____
[If] while seating cross-legged it does not rain on his knees, [this abode] is
sufficient for the abiding in comfort of a resolute bhikkhu.

_Pallaṅkena nisinnassa jaṇṇuke nābhivassati +
Alaṃ phāsuvihārāya pahitattassa bhikkhuno._
____

3. content [with what is paltry and easily gotten] anyway is the meaning of
'content with any old thing.'

===== With itarītarena + explicit object

When _itarītarena_ has an object, we say 'any old... whatsoever.' For example:

[quote, A.3.146]
____
In this regard a bhikkhu is content with any old robe, almsfood, abode, and
therapeutic requisite whatsoever

_Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu santuṭṭho hoti itarītarena cīvarena santuṭṭho
hoti itarītarena piṇḍapātena santuṭṭho hoti itarītarena senāsanena
santuṭṭho hoti itarītarena gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhārena._
____

===== Itarītarena santuṭṭhiṃ: contentment in relation to one or the other

The Buddha has said:

[quote, Vin.1.280]
____
'Whoever wishes may be a rag-robe wearer; whoever wishes may use robes given by
householders. And I praise contentment [with what is paltry and easily gotten]
in relation to one or the other.'

_Yo icchati paṃsukūliko hotu. Yo icchati gahapaticīvaraṃ sādiyatu.
Itarītarenapahaṃ bhikkhave santuṭṭhiṃ vaṇṇemī ti._
____

It makes sense even concerning robes from householders to render
_santuṭṭhiṃ_ as 'contentment [with what is paltry and easily gotten],'
because even robes from householders may be paltry. It also makes sense to
render _itarītarena_ as 'in relation to one or the other,' not 'with any old
thing,' because:

1. the dictionaries support it. PED: 'one or the other, whatsoever, any;' DOP:
'one or another; whatsoever, any sort of'

2. it led the bhikkhus to think:

[quote, Vin.1.282]
____
Only one (kind of) robe is allowed by the Blessed One, not two (kinds).

_ekaṃyeva bhagavatā cīvaraṃ anuññātaṃ. Na dve ti._
____

This led to an extension of the allowance:

[quote, Vin.1.282]
____
'I allow him who uses robes given by householders to also use rag-robes. And I
praise contentment [with what is paltry and easily gotten] in relation to both.'

_Anujānāmi bhikkhave gahapaticīvaraṃ sādiyantena paṃsukūlampi
sādiyituṃ. Tadubhayenapahaṃ bhikkhave santuṭṭhiṃ vaṇṇemī ti.._
____

We must now discuss the meaning of _tadubhayenapahaṃ santuṭṭhiṃ
vaṇṇemī_

===== Tadubhayenapahaṃ santuṭṭhiṃ vaṇṇemī

_Tadubhayenapahaṃ santuṭṭhiṃ vaṇṇemī_ cannot mean 'I praise
contentment on account of having both,' because:

1. It would make nonsense of the meaning of 'contentment.'

2. It is not in accordance with the orthodox definition of _santuṭṭhi,_
i.e. 'contentment [with what is paltry and easily gotten].'

3. It does not correspond to the meaning we have given to _itarītarena_ in
this context, i.e. 'And I praise contentment [with what is paltry and easily
gotten] in relation to one or the other.'

===== With aveccappasādena: blameworthy

In relation to _aveccappasādena_, contentment is considered blameworthy:

[quote, S.5.398]
____
Content with that unshakeable faith in the Buddha, he does not make further
effort for physical seclusion by day nor for solitary retreat at night.

_So tena buddhe aveccappasādena santuṭṭho na uttariṃ vāyamati divā
pavivekāya rattiṃ paṭisallānāya._
____

===== Sadārasantuṭṭho

_Sadārasantuṭṭho_ means 'content with one's wife,' which we render as
'happily married':

[quote, A.5.138]
____
My paternal uncle Isidatta was not celibate but was happily married

_Petteyyopi me bhante isidatto abrahmacārī ahosi sadārasantuṭṭho._
____

Bodhi likewise says: 'My paternal uncle Isidatta was not celibate but lived a
contented married life.'

=== Sappurisa

==== Renderings

- _sappurisa_: spiritually outstanding person

- _asappurisa_: common person

==== Introduction

===== Asappurisa and puthujjana

The following quote treats _asappurisa_ ('the common person') and _puthujjana_
('the common man') as equivalent, and shows that a _sappurisa_ is at least a
'faith follower' (_saddhānusārin_), and not necessarily a stream-enterer:

[quote, S.3.225]
____
One who has faith in [the significance of] these teachings and is intent upon
them is called a 'faith follower,' one who has entered the way of rightness
[comprised of spiritually wholesome factors], entered the plane of spiritually
outstanding people, transcended the plane of the common man. He is incapable of
doing any deed for which he might be reborn in hell, the animal realm, or the
sphere of ghosts; he is incapable of passing away without having realised the
fruit of stream-entry.

_yo bhikkhave ime dhamme evaṃ saddahati adhimuccati ayaṃ vuccati
saddhānusārī okkanto sammattaniyāmaṃ sappurisabhumiṃ okkanto vītivatto
puthujjanabhumiṃ abhabbo taṃ kammaṃ kātuṃ yaṃ kammaṃ katvā

Arahants are 'greater than _sappurisas'_ (_sappurisena sappurisataro_) in being
possessed of not eight, but ten path factors:

[quote, M.3.76]

=== Sabbe dhammā nālaṃ abhinivesāyā

==== Rendering

- _sabbe dhammā nālaṃ abhinivesāyā ti_: all things are unsuited to
stubborn attachment

==== Introduction

===== Sabbe dhammā: 'all things'

_Sabbe dhammā nālaṃ abhinivesāyā ti_ is a key phrase in the scriptures
because, having heard it (_sutaṃ hoti_), one 'fully understands the whole
teaching' (_sabbaṃ dhammaṃ abhijānāti_ M.1.252). However, there is no
agreement on how to best translate it. Even the opening words _sabbe dhammā_
are unsettled.

Horner calls _sabbe dhammā_ 'any (psycho-physical) conditions' in the
sentence: 'It is not fitting that there should be inclination towards any
(psycho-physical) conditions.' Bodhi transfers the negative so the sentence
reads 'Nothing is worth adhering to.'

===== Abhiniveso: firm, unyielding attachment

That _abhiniveso_ implies firm, unyielding attachment can be illustrated in
several ways:

1. In the royal banyan tree called Well Established. This tree was 'steadfastly
attached' to twelve leagues, but its roots spread to [a further] five
(_dvādasayojanāni abhiniveso ahosi pañcayojanāni mulakasantānakānaṃ_
A.3.369). These latter roots were therefore part of Well Established's
attachment, but not its _steadfast_ attachment.

2. In the attachment of the dogmatist who considers his opinion alone is
correct, which is called _idaṃsaccābhiniveso_, stubborn attachment to
dogmatic opinions.

3. In the attachment to one language whose vocabulary one might continue to use
in a different country:
+
[quote, M.3.235]
____
Whatever they label the thing in one particular country, dogmatically grasping
and stubbornly adhering to [his own term] he asserts 'This alone is right; all
else is wrong.'

_iti yathā yathā naṃ tesu tesu janapadesu sañjānanti tathā tathā
thāmasā parāmassa abhinivissa voharati idameva saccaṃ moghamaññan ti._
____

4. Where _abhiniveso_ is better called 'relentless attachment.' This is seen in
the wish of the _khattiya_ (_khattiyā_) to conquer land, the brahman to
perform sacrifices, the householder to work, the thief to operate in darkness,
and in women to be without co-wives.

===== Abhinivisati: to stubbornly adhere

That _abhiniveso_ implies stubborn attachment is apparent also in its relation
to _abhinivisati_ a similar-looking word from a different root, meaning
'stubbornly adhere.' It is effectively the verb form of _abhiniveso._
Illustrations given in more detail below show that stubbornly adhering (verb)
leads to:

1. Stubborn attachment (_abhinivesa_)
+
****
_rūpaṃ abhinivissa uppajjanti saṃyojanābhinivesa-vinibandhājjhosānā_
(S.3.187).
****

2. Religious dogmatism, in which one declares of one's own views 'This alone is
true, all else is false'
+
[quote, D.2.282]
____
The [religious] world is made up of many and various elements, and whatever
of these elements that beings stubbornly adhere to, then dogmatically grasping
and stubbornly adhering they assert 'This alone is true, all else is false.'

_Anekadhātunānādhātu kho devānaminda loko. Tasmiṃ

____

3. Stubbornly grasping of odious dogmatic views, like the bhikkhu Sāti:
+
[quote, M.1.257]
____
Although questioned, interrogated, and examined by those bhikkhus, the
bhikkhu Sāti, son of a fisherman, dogmatically grasping and stubbornly
adhering to that same odious dogmatic view, asserted 'As I understand the
teaching explained by the Blessed One, it is this personal _viññāṇa_ that
roams and wanders the round of birth and death, not another.'

_tadeva pāpakaṃ diṭṭhigataṃ thāmasā parāmassa abhinivissa

attachment

_yaññābhinivesā_

For a householder (_gahapatikā_), working is his relentless attachment

_kammantābhinivesā_

For a woman (_itthi_), being without a co-wife is her relentless attachment

_asapattībhinivesā_

For a thief (_corā_), darkness is his relentless attachment

_andhakārābhinivesā_

For an ascetic (_samaṇā_) possessionlessness is his relentless attachment

_ākiñcaññābhinivesā._
____

Comment:

To call a woman's wish to be without a co-wife a relentless attachment reflects
the culture, where being without a co-wife was hard to attain without
meritorious deeds (_dullabhāni akatapuññena_, S.4.249). The Buddha's father,
for example, had two wives, the blood sisters Mahāmāyā and Mahāpajāpatī,
and the bhikkhunī Uppalavaṇṇā was previously a co-wife.

COMMENT

If 'a bhikkhu abides contemplating [co-conditional] origination' is converted
into 'a bhikkhu abides contemplating origination factors' it has the following
effect: instead of the bhikkhu contemplating with his senses, he instead
contemplates with thought. But this would be impossible when mindfulness is
practised without thinking:

[quote, A.4.301]
____
When you have thus developed and cultivated this meditation, then bhikkhu you
should develop this meditation accompanied by thinking and pondering; without
thinking, just pondering; without thinking or pondering.

Comment:

Norman says the alternative reading _taṇhaṃ dukkhassa sambhavaṃ_
'probably arose from the inability of the scribes to fit the seeming nominative
_taṇhā_ into the structure of the sentence. This problem disappears when we
realise that _taṇhā_ is a truncated instrumental = _taṇhāya'_ (Group of
Discourses n.741). This view is supported by the commentary (which says _etaṃ
dukkhassa sambhavaṃ taṇhāya ādīnavaṃ ñatvā_) and also by the usual
meaning of _sambhava,_ which is 'arising' not 'origin.'

The scriptures rarely use the term _āyatanaṃ_ in reference to individual
senses. Although _saḷāyatanaṃ_ occurs 668 times, _cakkhāyatanaṃ_ occurs
just 11 times, and _cakkhundriyaṃ_ occurs 452 times. The shortage of
_cakkhāyatanaṃ_ is because _cakkhāyatanaṃ_ is usually abbreviated to
_cakkhuṃ_. The suffix -_āyatanaṃ_ is apparently disposable.

That _cakkhuṃ = cakkhāyatanaṃ_ is proven in several suttas. The
_Girimānanda Sutta_ says _cakkhuṃ_ is part of _āyatanesu_: _cakkhuṃ
anattā rūpā anattā... mano anattā dhammā anattā ti. Iti imesu chasu
ajjhattikabāhiresu āyatanesu anattānupassī viharati_ (A.5.109). Similar
evidence is found in the _Parihānadhamma Sutta_ (S.4.77) and the
_Chabbisodhana Sutta_ (M.3.32).

The fuller terms for all six senses is listed in the _Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta_:
_cakkhāyatanaṃ sotāyatanaṃ ghānāyatanaṃ jivhāyatanaṃ
kāyāyatanaṃ manāyatanaṃ_ (M.1.52).

===== Āyatanaṃ = phassāyatanānaṃ

But _āyatanaṃ_ is also an abbreviation -- for _phassāyatanānaṃ_. At
S.4.44 _cakkhuṃ_ is called _paṭhamaṃ phassāyatanaṃ_; _sotaṃ_ is
_dutiyaṃ phassāyatanaṃ_; and so on.

So _cakkhu's_ full name is _cakkhusamphassāyatanaṃ._ The others are
_sotasamphassāyatanaṃ ghānasamphassāyatanaṃ jivhāsamphassāyatanaṃ
kāyasamphassāyatanaṃ manosamphassāyatanaṃ_. These full terms occur just
once in the scriptures, in the _Dhātuvibhaṅga Sutta_ (M.3.239).

In this full rendering it is clear that _ayatana_ means 'basis.' For example,
'basis of _cakkhusamphassa'_ etc_._ So now let us examine the meaning of
_cakkhusamphassa_.

===== Cakkhusamphassa: visual sensation

_Cakkhusamphassa_ is explained in the following quote:

[quote, S.4.68]
____
Dependent on _cakkhu_ and visible objects there arises advertence to the visual
field. The meeting, the encounter, the concurrence of these three things is
called visual sensation.

_Cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṃ. Yā kho bhikkhave
imesaṃ tiṇṇaṃ dhammānaṃ saṅgati sannipāto samavāyo ayaṃ
vuccati bhikkhave cakkhusamphasso._
____

Thus _cakkhusamphassāyatanaṃ_ would mean 'basis for visual sensation.'

===== Terminology: full terms

The full terms of the six _āyatanā_ would therefore be:

[cols="2*"]
|===
| basis for visual sensation
| _cakkhuṃ_ or _cakkhāyatanaṃ_

| basis for auditory sensation
| _sotaṃ_ or _sotāyatanaṃ_

| basis for olfactory sensation
| _ghānaṃ_ or _ghānāyatanaṃ_

| basis for gustatory sensation
| _jivhā_ or _jivhāyatanaṃ_

| basis for tactile sensation
| _kāyo_ or _kāyāyatanaṃ_

| basis for mental sensation
| _mano_ or _manāyatanaṃ_
|===

===== Terminology: abbreviated

The full terms are unwieldy in practice, and we will instead abbreviate them:

- the visual sense

- the auditory sense

- the olfactory sense

- the gustatory sense

- the tactile sense

- the mental sense

===== External āyatana: full and concise renderings

The corresponding objects of sensation are the external _āyatana_ (_bāhirāni
āyatanāni_)_: rūpāyatanaṃ saddāyatanaṃ gandhāyatanaṃ rasāyatanaṃ
phoṭṭhabbāyatanaṃ dhammāyatanaṃ._ These terms are not abbreviations.
Therefore, if we again render _āyatana_ as 'basis,' then each of the
_āyatanas_ are 'a basis of sensation,' and the _āyatanas_ can be rendered as:

[quote, D.3.243]
____
visible objects basis of sensation

_rūpāyatanaṃ_

mentally known objects basis of sensation

_dhammāyatanaṃ._
____

But the phrase 'basis of sensation' is redundant, and so we render the terms as:

____
visible objects...

_rūpāyatanaṃ..._

mentally known objects

_dhammāyatanaṃ_
____

===== Justifying the plural: visible objects

We have used the word 'objects.' The plural case is justified for three reasons:

1. Context supports it.

2. For grammatical reasons, by which it could be singular or plural.

3. By the common occurrence elsewhere of the plural case when the internal
bases of sensation are in the singular case. For example:

[quote, M.3.281]
____
dependent on the visual sense and visible objects, advertence to the visual
field arises

_Cakkhuñca paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṃ._
____

===== Āyatanāni: renaming the Internal and external bases of sensation

The 'internal bases of sensation' can often instead be called 'the six senses,'
and the 'external bases of sensation' can often instead be called 'the six
sense objects.' For example:

[quote, M.3.32]
____
There are these six senses and their objects rightly explained by the Blessed
One who knows and sees [the nature of reality], the Arahant, the Perfectly
Enlightened One.

_cha kho panimāni āvuso ajjhattikabāhirāni āyatanāni tena bhagavatā
jānatā passatā arahatā sammāsambuddhena sammadakkhātāni._
____

[quote, D.3.223]
____

____

[quote, S.5.426]
____
And what is the noble truth of suffering? One should reply: the six senses.

____

[quote, S.4.174]
____

____

____

____

==== Renderings

- _sītibhūta_: freed from inward distress

==== Introduction

===== Summary

_Sītibhūta_ is linked to freedom from _taṇhā_, _rāga, dosa, moha,_ and
_āsava,_ and therefore to freedom from anguish (_pariḷāha_) and inward
torment (_pariḍayhati_). Although it is commonly rendered 'become cool,' and
PED calls it 'tranquillized,' _sītibhūta_ is better represented by the term
'freed from inward distress.'

===== Freedom from taṇhā, suffering, and burning

_Sītibhūta_ is linked to freedom from _taṇhā_:

[quote, Th.v.298]
____
Having removed [the arrow of] craving together with its origin, I am freed from
inward distress. I have realised the Untroubled.

_samūlaṃ taṇhaṃ abbuyha sītibhūtosmi nibbuto ti._
____

It is therefore linked to freedom from sufferings, torments, and anguishes,
because they are the products of _taṇhā_:

[quote, M.3.287]
____
Craving... grows. One's physical and psychological sufferings, torments, and
anguishes increase.

===== Freedom from rāga, dosa, moha, trouble, anguish, and burning

_Sītibhūta_ is linked to freedom from _rāga, dosa,_ and _moha_.

[quote, Th.v.79]
____
All my attachment is abandoned, my hatred is abolished, my undiscernment of
reality is done away with. I am freed from inward distress. I have realised the
Untroubled.

_Sabbo rāgo pahīno me sabbo doso samūhato +
Sabbo me vigato moho sītibhūtosmi nibbuto ti._
____

It is therefore linked to freedom from anguish, because that is the product of
_rāga, dosa_ and _moha_:

[quote, A.1.137]
____
Would there not arise in that householder or householder's son anguish of body
or mind that are born of attachment... hatred... undiscernment of reality, so
that, being tormented by the anguish born of attachment... hatred...
undiscernment of reality, he would sleep badly?

_Taṃ kimmaññasi kumāra? Api nu tassa gahapatissa vā gahapatiputtassa vā

____

===== Freedom from āsava, suffering and burning

_Sītibhūta_ is linked to freedom from _āsavas_:

[quote, Thī.v.76]
____
destroyed all perceptually obscuring states. I am freed from inward distress. I
have realised the Untroubled.

_khepetvā āsave sabbe sītibhūtāmhi nibbutā ti._

It is therefore linked to freedom from distress and anguish, because that is
the quality of the _āsavas_.

[quote, A.3.245]
____
Vexatious and anguishing perceptually obscuring states

_āsavā vighātapariḷāhā._
____

===== Conclusion

We have shown that _sītibhūta_ is linked to freedom from

- sufferings, torments, and anguishes

- inward trouble

- anguish of body or mind

- distress and anguish

It is thus well-represented by the term 'freed from inward distress.'

==== Overview: Sīlabbata

===== Sīla

The long description of _sīla_ in the _Brahmajāla Sutta_ shows that _sīla_
wholly involves the refraining from practices. The sutta's opening and closing
sentences related to _sīla_ are included in this quotation:

[quote, D.1.4-12]
____
What are the mere trifles, the mere trivialities, the mere matters of virtue,
that the common man would speak of when speaking in praise of the Perfect One?
The ascetic Gotama abandons and refrains from killing... And whereas some
ascetics and Brahmanists, living off food given in faith maintain themselves by
such base arts and wrong means of livelihood as... practising surgery,
practising as a children's doctor, administering medicines, and treatments to
cure their after-effects, the ascetic Gotama refrains from these kinds of base
arts and wrong means of livelihood.

_Katamañca taṃ bhikkhave appamattakaṃ oramattakaṃ sīlamattakaṃ yena
puthujjano tathāgatassa vaṇṇaṃ vadamāno vadeyya? Pāṇātipātaṃ

____

===== Vata

_Vata_, by contrast, involves both the undertaking of and refraining from
practices, as this illustration shows:

____
At one time there was a naked ascetic living in Vesāli called
Kaḷāramaṭṭhuka ... He had undertaken seven rules of practice
(_vatapadāni_):

_Tena kho pana samayena acelo kaḷāramaṭṭhuko vesāliyaṃ
paṭivasati... tassa satta vatapadāni samattāni samādinnāni honti:_
____

1. For the rest of my life I will be a naked ascetic and will not wear clothes;
+
****
_Yāvajīvaṃ acelako assaṃ na vatthaṃ paridaheyyaṃ._
****

2. For the rest of my life I will remain celibate and abstain from sexual
intercourse;
+
****
_Yāvajīvaṃ brahmacārī assaṃ na methunaṃ dhammaṃ paṭiseveyyaṃ._
****

3. For the rest of my life I will subsist on liquor and meat, abstaining from
boiled rice and junket;
+
****
_Yāvajīvaṃ surāmaṃseneva yāpeyyaṃ na odanakummāsaṃ bhuñjeyyaṃ._
****

[quote, D.3.9]
____
4-7) I will not go beyond the Udena Shrine to the east of Vesāli, the Gotamaka
Shrine to the south, the Sattamba Shrine to the west, nor the Bahuputta Shrine
to the north.

_Puratthimena vesāliṃ udenaṃ nāma cetiyaṃ taṃ nātikkameyyaṃ

pacchimena vesāliṃ sattambaṃ nāma cetiyaṃ taṃ nātikkameyyaṃ
uttarena vesāliṃ bahuputtaṃ nāma cetiyaṃ taṃ nātikkameyyanati._
____

===== Sīlabbata: pluralising

_Sīla_ and _vata_ together become _sīlabbataṃ_ (singular case), which, like
others do, we pluralise ('observances and practices'):

- Norman: 'virtuous conduct and vows' (Sn.v.231).

- Bodhi: 'rules and vows' (S.5.118).

- Bodhi: 'behaviour and observances' (A.1.225)

==== Spiritually unwholesome observances and practices

===== Discarding religious practices

Religious practices that are not in accordance with the Noble One's training
system (_ariyassa vinaye_) are abandoned by disciples when they first take
refuge in the Buddha, when they see that these practices are ineffective or
spiritually unwholesome, as the following stories show:

===== *1) Fire veneration:* a stain

When Kassapa of Uruvelā and his group of matted-hair ascetic disciples decided
to take ordination under the Buddha, they flung into the river their hair,
braids, bundles on carrying poles, and fire-venerating implements (Vin.1.32-3).
Kassapa explained this action as follows:

[quote, Vin.1.36]
____
'Brahmanic sacrifices glorify sights and sounds, also flavours, sensuous
pleasures, and women.

_Rūpe ca sadde ca atho rase ca +
Kāmitthiyo cābhivadanti yaññā_

'Recognising that this was a spiritual stain amidst objects of attachment I
lost my taste for sacrifices and offerings.'

_Etaṃ malan ti upadhīsu ñatvā +
Tasmā na yiṭṭhe na hute arañjin ti._
____

===== *2) Sacrifice*: demeritorious, spiritually unwholesome

[quote, A.4.43]
____
A brahman brought hundreds of bulls, goats, and sheep to the sacrificial post
for slaughter and burning. When he asked how to perform the sacrifice so it
would be of the greatest benefit, the Buddha said that even in preparing for
such a sacrifice, thinking one is making merit, one makes demerit; thinking one
is doing what is spiritually wholesome, one is doing what is spiritually
unwholesome; thinking one is on the path to heaven, one is on the path to woe.

_So puññaṃ karomī ti apuññaṃ karoti. Kusalaṃ karomīti akusalaṃ
karoti. Sugatimaggaṃ pariyesāmī ti duggatimaggaṃ pariyesati._
____

On becoming a lay follower, the brahman released his 2,500 sacrificial animals,
saying, 'May they eat fresh grass, drink cool water, and be cooled by a fresh
breeze!'

===== *3) River cleansing:* not purifying

[quote, M.1.39]
____
The brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja said "the Bahuka River is reckoned by many
to be liberating, it is reckoned by many to be meritorious, and many wash away
the demerit they have created in the Bahuka River."

_Mokkhasammatā hi bho gotama bāhukā nadī bahujanassa puññasammatā hi bho
gotama bāhukā nadī bahujanassa bāhukāya pana nadiyā bahujano
pāpakammaṃ kataṃ pavāhetī ti._

The Buddha replied, "a fool may bathe there forever, yet will not purify
himself of accumulated demerit."

_Niccampi bālo pakkhanno kaṇhakammo na sujjhati._
____

On hearing this, the brahman requested ordination as a bhikkhu.

===== 4) River cleansing: not purifying

A brahman told the bhikkhunī Puṇṇikā that whoever, young or old, does a
demeritorious deed (_pāpakamma pakubbatī_) is released from the accumulated
demerit by water ablution (_dakābhisecanā sopi pāpakammā pamuccati_).
Puṇṇikā replied that in that case, they'd all go to heaven: all the frogs,
turtles, reptiles, crocodiles, and anything else that lives in the water. She
said that if rivers could carry off one's accumulated demerit (_pāpaṃ pubbe
kataṃ vahuṃ_), they would carry off one's accumulated merit as well
(_puññampimā vaheyyuṃ_). She advised the brahman to stop doing whatever it
was that made him always need cleansing (_yassa brāhmaṇa tvaṃ bhīto sadā
udakamotari tameva brahme mā kāsi_) and added "Don't let the cold hurt your
skin (_mā te sītaṃ chaviṃ hane_)."

The Brahman agreed that he had been following the wrong path, and now had been
shown the noble path (_kummaggaṃ paṭipannaṃ maṃ ariyamaggaṃ
samānayi_) (Thī.v.236-251). On becoming a bhikkhu, and being enlightened, he
exclaimed:

[quote, Thī.v.251]
____
Formerly I was Brahmā's offspring, today I am a true Brahman, a master of the
three final knowledges, endowed with profound knowledge, fully versed in
profound knowledge, spiritually cleansed.

_Brahmabandhu pure āsiṃ ajjamhi saccabrāhmaṇo +
Tevijjo vedasampanno sottiyo camhi nahātako ti._
____

==== Noble observances and practices: 'noble' or 'Noble One's discipline'

===== Noble observances and practices

The terms 'noble' or 'Noble One's discipline' are constantly associated with
exalted types of observances and practices, as the next paragraphs show. This
justifies us sometimes rendering _sīlabbata_ as '[noble] observances and
practices.'

===== *1) Self-mortifying practice: no attainment of* noble discernment

Before his enlightenment, the Buddha practised various ascetic practices. For
instance, nakedness; remaining standing when eating, urinating and defaecating;
licking his hands clean instead of washing them. He tortured himself by either
standing continuously, rejecting seats; or by maintaining the squatting
position; or by using a bed of spikes; or by bathing in cold water three times
daily including the evening. He survived on very small amounts of food, and
reached a state of extreme emaciation.

Yet by such conduct and self-mortification he admitted that he did not attain
any superhuman attainment of knowledge and vision that was truly noble
(_uttarimanussadhammā alamariyañāṇadassanavisesaṃ_), because he did not
attain noble discernment (_ariyāya paññāya_) which leads to the complete
destruction of suffering (_sammā dukkhakkhayāya_, M.1.81). Later, he was to
reflect:

[quote, S.1.103]
____
"I am indeed freed from that unpleasant self-mortifying practice. It is good
indeed that I am freed from that useless, unpleasant, self-mortifying practice.
It is good that, steady and mindful, I have attained enlightenment"

_mutto vatamhi tāya dukkarakārikāya. Sādhu mutto vatamhi tāya
anatthasaṃhitāya dukkarakārikāya. Sādhu ṭhito sato bodhiṃ
samajjhaganti._
____

===== *2) Going upwards:* Noble One's discipline

[quote, S.5.361]
____
There is a brahman practice called 'going upwards' (_udayagāminiṃ nāma
paṭipadaṃ_) in which a disciple is told to get up early and walk facing
east, and told not to avoid a pit, a precipice, a stump, a thorny place, a
village pool, or a cesspool, and told to "expect death wherever you fall. Thus,
good man, with the demise of the body at death, you will be reborn in the realm
of happiness, in the heavenly worlds.

_Yattha pateyyāsi tattheva maraṇaṃ āgaccheyyāsi. Evaṃ tvaṃ ambho
purisa kāyassa bhedā parammaraṇā sugatiṃ saggaṃ lokaṃ
uppajjissasīti_

The Buddha called this a foolish and stupid practice (_bāla gamanametaṃ
mūḷhagamanametaṃ_) and instead proclaimed the way of going upwards in the
Noble One's training system (_ariyassa vinaye udayagāminiṃ paṭipadaṃ
paññāpemi_). This involves having unshakeable faith in the [perfection of
the] Buddha's [transcendent insight]... in the [significance of the]
teaching... in the [praiseworthiness of the] community of disciples'
[application to the practice], and being possessed of the virtues dear to the
Noble Ones.

_idha bhikkhave ariyasāvako buddhe aveccappasādena samannāgato hoti...Dhamme
aveccappasādena samannāgato hoti... Saṅghe aveccappasādena samannāgato
hoti... Ariyakantehi sīlehi samannāgato hoti._
____

===== *3) Purifying rites* in the Noble One's training system

Cunda was a silversmith whose purifying rites involved him touching the ground,
cowdung, or grass; venerating fire or the sun; and bathing three times a day.
The Buddha said that this was different from the purification in the Noble
One's training system (_ariyassa vinaye soceyyaṃ_) which, at Cunda's request,
he explained meant practising the four ways of right speech, the three ways of
right conduct, and being free of greed, ill will, and wrong view [of reality].
He said:

[quote, A.5.263-268]
____
These ten paths of spiritually wholesome conduct are purified and purifying.

_Ime cunda dasa kusalakammapathā suciyeva honti sucikaraṇā ca_

If one who follows these ten paths of spiritually wholesome conduct, gets up
early and strokes the ground from his bed, then he is spiritually purified, and
if he does not stroke the ground, he is still spiritually purified.

_Imehi kho dasahi kusalakammapathehi samannāgato kālasseva uṭṭhahantova
sayanambhā paṭhaviṃ cepi āmasati suciyeva hoti. No cepi paṭhaviṃ
āmasati suci yeva hoti._
____

===== *4) Venerating and serving: according to the* Noble One's discipline

One early morning, the Buddha met a young brahman named Sigālaka, who, with
joined palms, was venerating (_namassati_) the six directions. The Buddha told
him:

____
But, young man, that is not how the six directions would be venerated in the
Noble One's training system.

_Na kho gahapatiputta ariyassa vinaye evaṃ chaddisā namassitabbā ti._
____

When Sigālaka asked the Buddha to explain this, the Buddha explained, not how
to 'venerate' the six directions, but how to 'cover' them (_paṭicchādī_),
which he explained meant 'serving' the people in one's life
(_paccupaṭṭhātabbā_) because it is likely that 'venerating' was a term
that he felt should be used exclusively in relationship to the Buddha, the
teaching, and the community of the Blessed One's disciples. He told Sigālaka
how to properly serve six groups of people: one's parents, teachers, spouses,
friends, servants, and ascetics and Brahmanists, and if one does so, they will
tenderly reciprocate (_anukampanti_). The Buddha said that if one follows this
advice, then each direction is made safe, free of fear (_khemā
appaṭibhayā_). This is presumably because one is not developing danger and
fear within any relationship. Instead, one is developing three qualities that
might summarise the Buddha's advice to Sigālaka: respect, kindness and
dutifulness (D.3.180). At the end of the discourse Sigālaka became a lay
disciple.

===== Noble observances and practices: parenthesis

Because 'noble' or 'Noble One's discipline' are constantly associated with
exalted types of observances and practices, if necessary, we parenthesise them
as such:

[quote, A.1.168]
____
He who is perfect in [noble] observances and practices, resolutely applied [to
the practice], and inwardly collected, with a mind that is mastered,
concentrated, and well-collected...

_Yo sīlabbatasampanno pahitatto samāhito +
Cittaṃ yassa vasībhūtaṃ ekaggaṃ susamāhitaṃ._
____

===== Bhikkhus observances and practices

Bhikkhus observances and practices are divided into

1. the Pātimokkha rules (see _The Buddhist Monastic Code_, Volume One, by
Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu)

2. Khandhaka rules (see _The Buddhist Monastic Code_, Volume Two, by
Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu).

===== Subbata: 'one with noble practices'

Because we call the arahant's _sīlabbata_ 'noble,' we call _subbata_ 'one with
noble practices':

[quote, Th.v.19]
____
Irrigators channel water. Fletchers straighten arrows. Carpenters shape wood.
Those with noble practices tame themselves.

_Udakaṃ hi nayanti nettikā usukārā namayanti tejanaṃ +
Dāruṃ namayanti tacchakā attānaṃ damayanti subbatā ti._
____

[quote, Sn.v.89]
____
Assuming an outward semblance of those with noble practices, insolent, a
corrupter of families, impudent, deceitful, unrestrained, mere chaff, living
the religious life in disguise, he is a defiler of the Path.

_Chadanaṃ katvāna subbatānaṃ pakkhandī kuladūsako pagabbho +
Māyāvī asaṃyato palāpo patirūpena caraṃ sa maggadūsī._
____

==== Adherence to observances and practices: sīlabbataparāmāso

Noble observances are to be practised without attachment. For example, the
stream-enterer is 'possessed of the precepts dear to the Noble Ones'
(_ariyakantehi sīlehi samannāgato hoti_) which are perfectly fulfilled, but
they are not grasped (_aparāmaṭṭhehi_). Adherence to observances and
practices (_sīlabbataparāmāso_) is one of the five ties to individual
existence in the low plane of existence (_orambhāgiyāni saṃyojanāni_).
'Adherence' has two symptoms:

1. Regarding one's own practices as true, and others' as false:
+
[quote, M.1.498]
____
If I, dogmatically grasping and stubbornly adhering, should declare "This
alone is true. All else is false," I will dispute with those of the other two
views.'

_ahaṃ diṭṭhiṃ thāmasā parāmāsā abhinivissa vohareyyaṃ– idameva
saccaṃ moghamaññan ti; dvīhi me assa viggaho._
____

2. Taking one's virtue personally. Thus the _Samaṇamaṇḍikā Sutta_
proclaims a virtuous bhikkhu who does not regard virtue as endowed with
personal qualities (_bhikkhu sīlavā hoti no ca sīlamayo_, M.2.27). For
discussion on _sīlamayo_ see Glossary sv _Atammayo_.

[quote, Sn.v.624]
____
One who is not ill-tempered, who is [perfect in noble] observances and
practices, who is free of conceit, inwardly tamed, and bears his final body, he
is what I call a Brahman.

_Akkodhanaṃ vatavantaṃ sīlavantaṃ anussadaṃ +
Dantaṃ antimasarīraṃ tamahaṃ brūmi brāhmaṇaṃ._

COMMENT:

We take _vatavantaṃ sīlavantaṃ_ as _sīlabbatasampannaṃ._ Norman
translates literally 'possessing vows and virtuous conduct,' which is not
meaningful. Like us, the commentary considers that perfection is implied:
_Vatantanti dhutavatena samannāgataṃ, catupārisuddhisīlena sīlavantaṃ._
The term _sīlabbatasampanno_ occurs at A.1.168. See IGPT sv _Sīlabbata_.

[quote, A.1.168]
____
He who is perfect in [noble] observances and practices, resolutely applied [to

Also consider:

[quote, A.3.261]
____
A resident bhikkhu is not to be esteemed (_āvāsiko bhikkhu abhāvanīyo
hoti_) if he is imperfect in behaviour and in the practice of observances;

_Na ākappasampanno hoti na vattasampanno._
____

[quote, A.4.352]
____
A bhikkhu is virtuous, abides restrained [in conduct] within the constraints of
the rules of discipline. He is perfect in conduct and sphere of personal
application, seeing danger in the slightest wrongdoing.

===== Suñña: void [of personal qualities]

_Suñña_ has a technical sense, meaning 'void [of personal qualities]':

[quote, S.4.54]
____
'Void [of personal qualities] is the world [of phenomena]': on what grounds,
bhante, is this said?

_suñño loko suñño loko ti bhante vuccati kittāvatā nu kho bhante suñño
loko ti vuccatī ti?_

'Because, Ānanda, it is void of an [absolute] Selfhood and of what could
belong to an [absolute] Selfhood, therefore it is said that the world [of
phenomena] is void [of personal qualities].'_

_Yasmā ca kho ānanda suññaṃ attena vā attaniyena vā tasmā suñño loko

____

===== Suññatā: three meanings

_Suññatā_ has three meanings:

1. [the perception of][relative] voidness

2. The [perception of the] absence [of any abiding phenomena]

3. The [perception of the] absence [of personal qualities]

We illustrate these as follows:

===== 1) Suññatā: [the perception of][relative] voidness

[quote, M.3.104]
____
In the same way, Ānanda, a bhikkhu, not focusing upon the perceptions of
village and man, focuses undistractedly on the perception of forest. His mind
becomes energised, serene, settled, and intent upon the perception of forest.

_evameva kho ānanda bhikkhu amanasikaritvā gāmasaññaṃ amanasikaritvā
manussasaññaṃ araññasaññaṃ paṭicca manasikaroti ekattaṃ. Tassa
araññasaññāya cittaṃ pakkhandati pasīdati santiṭṭhati adhimuccati._

He knows that "Whatever states of suffering there are because of the
perceptions of village and man are absent. And there is only this amount of
suffering, namely the undistracted concentration focused on the perception of
forest."

_So evaṃ pajānāti ye assu darathā gāmasaññaṃ paṭicca tedha na santi

and man. And there is just this state which is not absent, namely the
undistracted concentration focused on the perception of forest."

This is for him the undistorted, pure realisation of [the perception of]

And what, bhante, is the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states]
through the [perception of the] absence [of personal qualities]?

_Katamā ca bhante suññatā cetovimutti_

In this regard a bhikkhu, gone to the wilderness, or the root of a tree, or a
solitary abode, reflects thus: 'This is void of an [absolute] Selfhood and of
what could belong to an [absolute] Selfhood.'

===== Suññatā: dividing 'internal' and 'external'

When receiving visitors, the Buddha, although unaware of any abiding phenomena
internally, perceived abiding phenomena externally through conventional
perception, and would therefore be able to properly communicate with visitors:

[quote, M.3.111]
____
There is this abiding discovered by the Perfect One, namely to enter and abide
in the [perception of the] absence [of any abiding phenomena] internally, by
not focusing upon any abiding phenomenon. And if he is abiding thus, he is
visited by bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, laymen, laywomen, kings and kings' ministers,
and non-Buddhist ascetics and their disciples, then the Perfect One, with his
mind mentally inclining, verging, and drifting towards seclusion [from sensuous
pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors], psychologically withdrawn [from
sensuous pleasures and spiritually unwholesome factors], taking delight in the
practice of unsensuousness, is one whose words are exclusively connected with
religious inspiration.

==== Introduction

===== The Exquisite means the Imperturbable

We will show in 8 steps that the Exquisite means fourth jhāna.

1. Meditation on [unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill leads to the Exquisite:
+
[quote, S.5.119]
____
Bhikkhus, the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through
[unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill has the Exquisite as its culmination, I
declare, for a wise bhikkhu here who has not penetrated to a superior
liberation.

_Subhaparamāhaṃ bhikkhave mettā cetovimuttiṃ vadāmi idha paññassa
bhikkhuno uttariṃ vimuttiṃ appaṭivijjhato._
____

2. Having a mind that is immeasurable, unlimited, and well developed leads to
the Imperturbable:
+
[quote, M.2.262]
____
How about if I, by transcending the world [of sensuous pleasure] with resolve,
were to abide with an awareness that was abundant and enlarged (_vipulena
mahaggatena cetasā_)? Having done so, unvirtuous, spiritually unwholesome
mental states such as greed, ill will, and aggressiveness would not exist. With
their abandonment, my mind would become immeasurable, unlimited, and well
developed (_aparittañca me cittaṃ bhavissati appamāṇaṃ subhāvitan_).
Applying himself and frequently abiding in this way, his mind becomes serene
through that practice of spiritual development. When there is serenity, he
either attains the Imperturbable now, or else he is intent upon discernment.

_Yannūnāhaṃ vipulena mahaggatena cetasā vihareyyaṃ abhibhuyya lokaṃ
adhiṭṭhāya manasā. Vipulena hi me mahaggatena cetasā viharato abhibhuyya
lokaṃ adhiṭṭhāya manasā. Ye pāpakā akusalā manasā abhijjhāpi
sārambhāpi te na bhavissanti. Tesaṃ pahānā aparittañca me cittaṃ
bhavissati appamāṇaṃ subhāvitan ti. Tassa evaṃ paṭipannassa
tabbahulavihārino āyatane cittaṃ pasīdati. Sampasāde sati etarahi vā
āneñjaṃ samāpajjati paññāya vā adhimuccati._
____

3. _Aniñjita_ includes fourth jhāna:
+
[quote, M.1.454-5]
____
Fourth jhāna I declare, is within the not-unstable.

_catutthaṃ jhānaṃ... aniñjitasmiṃ vadāmi._
____
+
Other jhānas are within the unstable:
+
[quote, M.1.454]
____
He enters and abides in third jhāna. That, I declare, is within the unstable.

_tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. Idampi kho ahaṃ udāyi
iñjitasmiṃ vadāmi._
____

4. _Āneñjaṃ_ and _aniñjita_ are synonyms. For example, Sn.v.750-1 says:
+
[quote, Sn.v.750-1]
____
Whatever suffering arises, all of it arises dependent on spiritual
instability (_iñjitapaccayā_) ... Therefore having relinquished spiritual
instability (_ejaṃ vossajja_), imperturbable (_anejo_) and free of grasping,
the bhikkhu should mindfully fulfil the ideals of religious asceticism.
____

5. Therefore, fourth jhāna is part of the Imperturbable.

6. The immaterial states are also part of the Imperturbable:
+
[quote, A.2.184]
____
And how is a bhikkhu one who has attained the Imperturbable? In this regard, by
completely transcending refined material states of awareness, with the
vanishing of states of refined awareness involving physical sensation, not
focusing upon states of refined awareness involving the external senses, a
bhikkhu enters and abides in the state of awareness of boundless space where
one perceives that space is boundless... By completely transcending the state
of awareness of nonexistence, a bhikkhu enters and abides in the state of
awareness neither having nor lacking perception.

_Kathaṃ ca bhikkhave bhikkhu āneñjappatto hoti? Idha bhikkhave bhikkhu
sabbaso rūpasaññānaṃ samatikkamā paṭighasaññānaṃ atthaṅgamā
nānattasaññānaṃ amanasikārā ananto ākāsoti ākāsānañcāyatanaṃ
upasampajja viharati... Sabbaso ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ samatikkamma
nevasaññānāsaññāyatanaṃ upasampajja viharati. Evaṃ kho bhikkhave
bhikkhu āneñjappatto hoti._
____
+
However, these immaterial states cannot be called the Exquisite, because in the
list of the eight states of refined awareness the Exquisite is clearly
separated from the immaterial states. For example, the third and fourth states
are:
+
____
One is focused exclusively on the Exquisite. This is the third state of refined
awareness

_Subhanteva adhimutto hoti. Ayaṃ tatiyo vimokkho._
____
+
[quote, "D.2.71, M.2.13, A.4.307"]
____
By completely transcending refined material states of awareness, with the
vanishing of states of refined awareness involving physical sensation, not
focusing upon states of refined awareness involving the external senses, one
enters and abides in the state of awareness of boundless space where one
perceives that space is boundless. This is the fourth state of refined awareness

_Sabbaso rūpasaññānaṃ samatikkamā paṭighasaññānaṃ atthaṅgamā
nānattasaññānaṃ amanasikārā ananto ākāso ti ākāsanañcāyatanaṃ
upasampajja viharati. Ayaṃ catuttho vimokkho.._
____

7. In developing _mettā_, one develops a mind that is abundant, exalted and
measureless (_cetasā vipulena mahaggatena appamāṇena_):
+
[quote, M.1.126]
____
We shall abide pervading the whole world [of beings] with a mind of [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill, vast, exalted, unlimited, free of unfriendliness
and hostility.

_sabbāvantaṃ lokaṃ mettāsahagatena cetasā vipulena mahaggatena
appamāṇena averena avyāpajjhena pharitvā viharissāmāti._
____

8. According to point 2), the qualities of the mind that are aroused in
practising _mettā_ would lead the meditator to the Imperturbable i.e. to
fourth jhāna. Therefore the Exquisite equals fourth jhāna because [unlimited,
all-encompassing] goodwill has the Exquisite as its culmination, says point 1).

===== The divine abidings, the Exquisite, and the immaterial states

The divine abidings have the following points of culmination:

[quote, S.5.119]
____
_Mettā_: the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through
[unlimited, all-encompassing] goodwill has the Exquisite as its culmination.

_subhaparamāhaṃ bhikkhave mettā cetovimuttiṃ vadāmi._
____

[quote, S.5.120]
____
_Karuṇā_: the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through
[unlimited, all-encompassing] compassion has the state of awareness of
boundless space as its culmination.

_ākāsānañcāyatanaparamāhaṃ bhikkhave karuṇā cetovimuttiṃ vadāmi._
____

[quote, S.5.120]
____
_Muditā_: the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through
[unlimited, all-encompassing] joy has the state of awareness of boundless
mental consciousness as its culmination.

_viññāṇañcāyatanaparamāhaṃ bhikkhave muditā cetovimuttiṃ vadāmi._
____

[quote, S.5.121]
____
_Upekkhā_: the liberation [from perceptually obscuring states] through
[unlimited, all-encompassing] detached awareness has the state of awareness of
nonexistence as its culmination.

_ākiñcaññāyatanaparamāhaṃ bhikkhave upekkhā cetovimuttiṃ vadāmi._
____

It neatly fits the sequence to consider the Exquisite as fourth jhāna.

And what, Ānanda, is the perception of the unloveliness [of the body]? In this

soles of the feet up, and down from the hair on the crown of the head, covered
in skin is full of various foul things. In this [wretched human] body there are
head-hairs... urine. Thus he abides contemplating the unloveliness of this
[wretched human] body.

==== Introduction

===== Conditionality not causality

The Buddha's teachings primarily concern conditionality not causality. Hence we
render _hetu_ as 'cause' only when it means 'reason,' where it is often linked
to _paccayo_:

[quote, S.4.324]
____
Eight causes and reasons for the ruination of families:

_Aṭṭha kho gāmaṇī hetu aṭṭha paccayā kulānaṃ upaghātāya._

Bhante, what is the cause and reason for the Perfect One being sometimes
disposed to explain the teaching, and sometimes not?

_Ko nu kho bhante hetu ko paccayo yena appekadā tathāgataṃ dhammadesanā
paṭibhāti appekadā nappaṭibhātīti._
____

===== Conditionality

The Buddha's teachings primarily concern conditionality not causality. Saying
that 'Dependent on birth, there arises old-age-and-death (S.2.1) does not mean
that birth causes old-age-and-death, but that birth is old-age-and-death's
indispensible condition.

===== The abstract formula of dependent origination

Conditionality is summarised in the abstract formula of dependent origination:

[quote, S.2.70]
____
When there is this, that comes to be. With the arising of this, that arises.
Without this, that does not come to be. With the ending of this, that ceases.

Comment:

'The profound understanding [and destruction of the great masses of greed,
hatred, and undiscernment of reality]': _Nibbijjhati_ means 'to pierce,' which
we call 'to profoundly understand.' At S.5.88 _nibbijjhati_ is linked to
_padāleti_ (to destroy), and to _lobhakkhandhaṃ dosakkhandhaṃ
mohakkhandhaṃ._
