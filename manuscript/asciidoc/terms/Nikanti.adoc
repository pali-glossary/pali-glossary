[quote, A.4.48]
____
If a bhikkhu's mind is imbued with the perception of [the ever-present 
possibility of] death, his mind draws back, bends back, and turns away from the 
hankering for life, and is not attracted to it, and either indifference or 
loathing is established in him.

_Maraṇasaññā paricitena bhikkhave bhikkhuno cetasā bahulaṃ viharato 
jīvitanikantiyā cittaṃ patilīyati patikuṭati pativaṭṭati na 
sampasārīyati upekkhā vā paṭikkūlyatā vā saṇṭhāti._
